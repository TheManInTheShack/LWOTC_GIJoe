;    1.0    Holo Targeting                Any directed primary weapon shot, hit or miss, will mark the target, increasing your squad's aim by +15 against this target.|Directed primary weapon-specific abilities will grant Holo Targeting.|Any abilities that target multiple units will not grant Holo Targeting.
;    1.0    Formidable                    Your gear includes an extra layer of protection, granting 2 bonus ablative hit points and 50% less damage from explosive attacks.|Formidable reduces explosive damage taken by 50%.
;    2.0    Squadsight                    You can target enemies within squadmates' sight, provided there is line of sight to the target.|Squadsight is best augmented by high ground, allowing soldiers relatively clear sight lines and an additional aim bonus to offset Squadsight's aim penalty.|When using Squadsight, there is no limit on how far your targets can be, but an aim penalty accumulates with distance.|Overwatch shots do not use squadsight by default.
;    3.0    Mayhem                        Gain 25% bonus damage against enemies who attempt to move when suppressed.
;    4.0    HiDef Holo                    Your Holotargeted enemies are easier to critically hit.|The critical hit bonus is +10 with the basic Holotargeter, but improves to +15 and +20 with advanced technology Holotargeting devices.
;    5.0    Independent Tracking          A Holotargeted enemy will remain so for 1 additional turn(s).|A Holotargeted enemy remains so for 1 additional turn(s).|Additional uses of Holotargeting on the same target will not stack.
;    6.0    Aim Assist                    Gain additional +15 aim and +15 crit against holotargeted units.|Notes: Either the Holotargeter or the Holo Targeting perk works for this perk.
;    7.0    Vital Point Targeting         Attacks against your Holotargeted enemies deal more damage.|The Vital Point Targeting damage bonus is +1 for the basic Holotargeter, and increases to +2 with improved Holotargeting technology.|Damage bonus is applied to melee and direct (non-Area of Effect) projectile attacks.
;    8.0    Stiletto                      Shots fired with your primary weapon pierce 3 armor.
; 
;    91.0   Death From Above              Killing an enemy at a lower elevation with your primary weapon refunds a single action, and does not end your turn. Also grants a long-range accuracy bonus for sniper rifles.|Death From Above can combo well with pistol abilities or can simply make a soldier more mobile.|Also grants a long-range accuracy bonus for sniper rifles at any elevation.
;    91.0   Shadowstrike                  While concealed, gain +50 bonus aim and +50 bonus critical hit chance when attacking enemies.|Shadowstrike bonuses will apply if the soldier re-enters concealment in a mission.
;    91.0   Rapid Targeting               You may Holotarget an enemy as a free action with a 4 turn cooldown. In addition, Holotargeting no longer ends your turn.|Using your Holotargeter no longer ends your turn.|In addition, Rapid Targeting lets you periodically use Holotargeting against a single enemy as a free action.|This works with HiDef Holo, Independent Tracking, and Vital Point Targeting.|This does not stack with Multitargeting.|Rapid Targeting has a 4 turn cooldown.|Holotargeting does not break concealment for your squad.
;    91.0   Steady Hands                  If you did not move last turn, gain +10 Aim and +10 Critical chance.|The Steady Hands bonus does not stack over multiple turns.|Steady Hands doubles down on the need to find a high sniper's nest with good sightlines.

;    1.0    Squadsight                    You can target enemies within squadmates' sight, provided there is line of sight to the target.|Squadsight is best augmented by high ground, allowing soldiers relatively clear sight lines and an additional aim bonus to offset Squadsight's aim penalty.|When using Squadsight, there is no limit on how far your targets can be, but an aim penalty accumulates with distance.|Overwatch shots do not use squadsight by default.
;    1.0    Bombardier                    You may throw or launch grenades two additional tiles.|Your grenades have 2 tiles extra range.|This includes both launched and thrown grenades.
;    2.0    Salvo                         Launching or throwing grenades, using heavy weapons or using the Gauntlet's Rocket Launcher with your first action will not end your turn.|Soldiers with the Salvo ability are prime candidates for heavy armor.
;    3.0    Needle Grenades               Your explosives do not destroy loot when they kill enemies and deal 1 bonus damage to unarmored enemies.|You have received extra training that enables you to employ explosive grenades that deploy specialized slivers that leave enemy loot and corpse intact and tears through unreinforced material.|Loot and corpses of enemies killed by any other explosives of this soldier, such as heavy weapons, are also preserved.
;    4.0    Long Watch                    Allow Overwatch to trigger with Squadsight.|Like the Overwatch ability it upgrades, Long Watch suffers a base penalty to aim.|Long Watch also suffers the Squadsight penalty to aim that increases with distance.
;    5.0    Volatile Mix                  Your grenades' area of effect is increased by one tile.|Your grenades do regular and environmental damage in the expanded area of effect, and apply any additional effects there as well.
;    6.0    Biggest Booms                 Your grenades and standard rockets can inflict critical damage (50% chance for +3 damage).|Grenades, standard rockets, and MEC micromissiles can inflict critical damage (50% chance for +3 damage).|50% chance for critical damage is not affected by other critical chance modifiers.|Does not apply to non-damaging grenades or the concussion rocket or Bunker Buster abilities.|Grenade crits will grant +1 damage to ongoing damaging effects such as fire.
;    7.0    Combat Engineer               Your explosives do significantly greater damage to cover objects and other things on the battlefield.|More powerful than Sapper by itself, Combat Engineer stacks with Sapper to maximize environmental damage, although either perk alone will still destroy many cover objects.|Combat Engineer also prevents environmental damage from falling off from the center of an explosion, meaning you will destroy objects in a larger area.
;    8.0    Tandem Warheads               Your grenades, rockets and heavy weapons do full damage to the maximum extent of their area of effect.|Your grenades, rockets and heavy weapons do full damage to units to the maximum extent of their area of effect.|This doesn't apply to environmental damage.
; 
;    91.0   Walk Fire                     Take a highly accurate shot with +30 bonus to hit 66% damage and -30 crit. Uses 2 ammo.|This is a special shot in which the soldier adjusts their aim in the middle of an automatic weapon burst, conferring +30 aim and -30 crit and doing 66% damage.|Consumes 2 ammo.|Requires a burst-fire weapon; ability will not be available when a shotgun or sniper rifle is equipped as a primary weapon.
;    91.0   Deep Cover                    If you did not attack this turn, hunker down automatically.|Non-offensive actions like Reload can still be performed without invalidating Deep Cover.
;    91.0   Will To Survive               Enemy damage is reduced by 1 when in cover and attacked through that cover. Also grants 5 will.|Enemy damage is reduced by 1 when in cover and attacked through that cover.|Cover against explosives and other indirect attacks is calculated from the point of the explosion.|Armor piercing effects do not eliminate this bonus.|This unit also permanently gains 5 will.|This ability does not provide defensive bonuses if the unit is disoriented, stunned, panicking, on fire or otherwise impaired.
;    91.0   Aim                           Hunker Down now confers +20 Aim and +20 Crit to the first shot on the following turn.|The bonus granted by Aim can apply to any weapon shot.
;    91.0   Light 'Em Up                  Standard shots with your primary weapon are not turn-ending.
;    91.0   Iron Curtain                  Special shot that does 50% of normal damage but reduces target mobility for the following 2 turn(s). Cone-based attack with primary weapon.|If this cone-based attack hits, Iron Curtain does 50% of normal damage and imposes -8 mobility to the enemy for 2 turn(s).|Iron Curtain has a 3 turn cooldown.|Uses 3 ammo.|Can be used after moving.|Iron Curtain does not work with shotguns or sniper rifles.|Allies in the cone can be hit by this ability.

;    91.0   HEAT Warheads                 Your grenades now pierce up to 2 point(s) of armor and shred 1 additional point(s) of armor.|Your grenades now pierce (ignore) up to 2 point(s) of armor and shred 1 additional point(s) of armor.
;    91.0   Total Combat                  Throwing a grenade or using an item no longer ends the turn and grenades have no cooldown. In addition, you can throw grenades 2 tiles further and their radius is increased by 1. Grants a Grenade-only slot. Grants +5 aim and +1 mobility.|Total Combat adds even more flexibility to the Skirmisher's turns, allowing actions to be taken exactly when needed.|Removes the cooldown for grenades.|Grants both Bombard and Volatile Mix, hence it does not stack with either of them.
;    91.0   Sapper                        Your explosives can destroy many cover objects.|Sapper allows frag grenades and other explosives to destroy many cover objects.

;    92.0   Full Kit                      Grants +1 charge per grenade item in a utility slot.|Applies to explosive and support grenades as well as Battle Scanners.|Extra grenades provided by Smoker and Flashbanger abilities do not get extra charges.
;    92.0   Covering Fire                 Reaction shots confer an aim malus on enemies and can now be triggered by any enemy action, not just movement.|If triggered by an enemy action, Covering Fire will trigger before the enemy action completes.|In addition, having the Covering Fire ability confers a temporary aim penalty upon any units you take a reaction shot at, regardless of whether it was a covering fire shot or not.
;    92.0   Sustain                       If the soldier takes enough damage to be killed, they are immediately put in Stasis for 1 turn and their health is only reduced to 1 HP. This can only happen once per mission.|Beware that a sustained soldier may retain damaging status effects like poison or burning after emerging from Stasis.

;    1.0    Formidable                    Your gear includes an extra layer of protection, granting 2 bonus ablative hit points and 50% less damage from explosive attacks.|Formidable reduces explosive damage taken by 50%.
;    1.0    Heavy Weapons                 This soldier is trained to use the XCOM gauntlet, a combination Rocket Launcher and Flamethrower.|The XCOM gauntlet is an advanced device that carries both a mini-rocket launcher and a flamethrower.|The Rocket Launcher carries one rocket initially and that has a three-tile radius for its area of effect.|It may target anything in sight range.|Damage from rockets falls off from the point of impact.|The flamethrower is a short-range weapon that causes damage to multiple targets within a cone-shaped area of effect.|The flamethrower has two uses per battle. It does not damage mechanical units without upgrades.|Using either gauntlet ability requires one action and ends your turn.|Rocket accuracy is affected by the soldier's aim, target distance, and whether the soldier has used any actions already this turn. Low accuracy-rockets will have higher scatter values, meaning they are more likely to miss the target tile by greater distances. The rocket's maximum possible scatter is noted in the popup, while a value appearing with the targeting cursor will show the expected (average) scatter for a shot on that location.
;    2.0    HEAT Warheads                 Your grenades now pierce up to 2 point(s) of armor and shred 1 additional point(s) of armor.|Your grenades now pierce (ignore) up to 2 point(s) of armor and shred 1 additional point(s) of armor.
;    3.0    Fortify                       Activate to grant +20 defense until the beginning of the next turn. Does not cost an action. Has a 5 turn cooldown.|Activate to grant the soldier +20 defense until the beginning of the soldier's next turn.|Does not cost an action.|Fortify has a 5 turn cooldown.
;    4.0    Fire In The Hole              Your rockets are more accurate.|Your rockets are more likely to hit their intended point of impact, or at least close to it.|The maximum it can miss by is reduced by two tiles.
;    5.0    Smoker                        Grants one free smoke grenade item to your inventory
;    5.0    Dense Smoke                   Your smoke grenades confer an additional 10 defense.|Your smoke grenades confer an additional 10 defense to those within the smoke, for a total of 30.
;    6.0    Combat Engineer               Your explosives do significantly greater damage to cover objects and other things on the battlefield.|More powerful than Sapper by itself, Combat Engineer stacks with Sapper to maximize environmental damage, although either perk alone will still destroy many cover objects.|Combat Engineer also prevents environmental damage from falling off from the center of an explosion, meaning you will destroy objects in a larger area.
;    7.0    Bunker Buster                 Fire a special rocket that destroys buildings and other objects in the environment.|Fire a special rocket with a large area of effect that does moderate damage to enemies but huge damage to buildings, vehicles and other objects in the environment.|Requires both actions and usable only once per mission.

; 
;    91.0   Coup de Grâce                 Bonus to hit, damage, and critical chance with your weapon against a disoriented, stunned or panicking enemy.|Coup de GrÃ¢ce grants +50 aim, +50 critical chance and +2 damage against stunned and panicking enemies.|The bonuses are reduced against disoriented enemies.
;    91.0   Lick Your Wounds              Hunker Down restores 2 health when used, up to a maximum of 8 per mission, and removes poison, burning, and acid burning.|Hunker Down restores 2 health when used, up to a maximum of 8 per mission.|Removes poison, burning, and acid burning.
;    91.0   Center Mass                   You do one additional point of base damage when using guns.|You do one additional point of base damage with your primary weapon, pistols or a sawed-off shotgun.

;    91.0   Target Focus                  Your ranged attacks gain +10 aim and pierce 1 armor against unflankable enemies.|Unflankable enemies are ones that can't take cover, such as Drones, MECs and Berserkers.
;    91.0   Bring 'Em On                  Gain +1 damage on critical hits for every two enemies you can see, up to a maximum of +8. Works for the soldier's primary weapon and explosives.|Gain +1 damage on critical hits for every two enemies you can see, up to a maximum of +8.|Units visible at squadsight ranges do confer bonus.|Applies to damage from the soldier's primary weapon and, if the soldier has Biggest Booms, explosives (damaging grenades, rockets, etc.).
;    91.0   Squadsight                    You can target enemies within squadmates' sight, provided there is line of sight to the target.|Squadsight is best augmented by high ground, allowing soldiers relatively clear sight lines and an additional aim bonus to offset Squadsight's aim penalty.|When using Squadsight, there is no limit on how far your targets can be, but an aim penalty accumulates with distance.|Overwatch shots do not use squadsight by default.
;    92.0   Aggression                    Gain +5 critical chance for each enemy you can see, up to a maximum of 30.|Units visible at squadsight ranges do confer bonus.

;    92.0   Chain Shot                    Take a shot with an aim penalty of 10. If you hit the target, you take another shot on the target automatically.|Chain Shot requires 2 ammo points.|Chain Shot has a 4 turn cooldown.|Chain Shot can be devastating against non-cover enemies, or when augmented with aim bonuses.
;    92.0   Clutch Shot                   Once per mission, fire a pistol shot that cannot miss.
;    92.0   Full Kit                      Grants +1 charge per grenade item in a utility slot.|Applies to explosive and support grenades as well as Battle Scanners.|Extra grenades provided by Smoker and Flashbanger abilities do not get extra charges.
;    92.0   Sustain                       If the soldier takes enough damage to be killed, they are immediately put in Stasis for 1 turn and their health is only reduced to 1 HP. This can only happen once per mission.|Beware that a sustained soldier may retain damaging status effects like poison or burning after emerging from Stasis.

;    93.0   Sting Grenades                Your flashbang grenades have a 50% chance to stun enemies.|Enemies' innate flashbang resistance does not affect stun chance.

It does not damage mechanical units without upgrades.|Using either gauntlet ability requires one action and ends your turn.|Rocket accuracy is affected by the soldier's aim, target distance, and whether the soldier has used any actions already this turn.

;    92.0   Serial                        A powerful chained shot ability. For every kill made with your primary weapon, your actions will be refunded but your damage and crit chance will be reduced for every subsequent attack.|Serial is meant to chain enemy kills in a single action, as every kill is essentially free.|Every successful kill does result in a reduction to critical hit chance and damage, however.|Serial has a 7 turn cooldown.

;    1.0    Squadsight                    You can target enemies within squadmates' sight, provided there is line of sight to the target.|Squadsight is best augmented by high ground, allowing soldiers relatively clear sight lines and an additional aim bonus to offset Squadsight's aim penalty.|When using Squadsight, there is no limit on how far your targets can be, but an aim penalty accumulates with distance.|Overwatch shots do not use squadsight by default.
;    1.0    Fire In The Hole              Your rockets are more accurate.|Your rockets are more likely to hit their intended point of impact, or at least close to it.|The maximum it can miss by is reduced by two tiles.
;    2.0    Steady Hands                  If you did not move last turn, gain +10 Aim and +10 Critical chance.|The Steady Hands bonus does not stack over multiple turns.|Steady Hands doubles down on the need to find a high sniper's nest with good sightlines.
;    3.0    Javelin Rockets               The range of your rockets is increased by 6 tiles and you may hit targets beyond your visual range.
;    4.0    Fortify                       Activate to grant +20 defense until the beginning of the next turn. Does not cost an action. Has a 5 turn cooldown.|Activate to grant the soldier +20 defense until the beginning of the soldier's next turn.|Does not cost an action.|Fortify has a 5 turn cooldown.
;    5.0    Volatile Mix                  Your grenades' area of effect is increased by one tile.|Your grenades do regular and environmental damage in the expanded area of effect, and apply any additional effects there as well.
;    6.0    Avenger                       Once per turn, take a reaction shot with your primary weapon at a visible enemy that has fired upon a visible ally.|Avenger will not activate if this unit is shot at.|Can only activate during the enemy's turn.|Can only trigger once per turn.
;    7.0    Watch Them Run                After throwing or launching a grenade, you will automatically enter overwatch.
;    8.0    Tandem Warheads               Your grenades, rockets and heavy weapons do full damage to the maximum extent of their area of effect.|Your grenades, rockets and heavy weapons do full damage to units to the maximum extent of their area of effect.|This doesn't apply to environmental damage.
; 
;    91.0   Sapper                        Your explosives can destroy many cover objects.|Sapper allows frag grenades and other explosives to destroy many cover objects.
;    91.0   Sentinel                      When in overwatch, you may take two reaction shots.|Reaction shots may only target an enemy once.
;    91.0   Aim                           Hunker Down now confers +20 Aim and +20 Crit to the first shot on the following turn.|The bonus granted by Aim can apply to any weapon shot.
;    91.0   Lick Your Wounds              Hunker Down restores 2 health when used, up to a maximum of 8 per mission, and removes poison, burning, and acid burning.|Hunker Down restores 2 health when used, up to a maximum of 8 per mission.|Removes poison, burning, and acid burning.
;    91.0   Light 'Em Up                  Standard shots with your primary weapon are not turn-ending.
;    91.0   Locked On                     Gain +20 aim and +20 crit for successive shots at the same enemy unit.|Gain +20 aim and +20 crit for repeated shots at the same target. Not cumulative, and only applies to enemy units.|Area-of-Effect-based shots do not grant the bonus.
;    91.0   Survival Instinct             Gain 20 Defense and 20 Crit chance while injured.|The bonuses are lost if you are healed back to full health.
;    91.0   HEAT Warheads                 Your grenades now pierce up to 2 point(s) of armor and shred 1 additional point(s) of armor.|Your grenades now pierce (ignore) up to 2 point(s) of armor and shred 1 additional point(s) of armor.
;    92.0   Heavy Ordnance                Any damaging grenade in your grenade-only slot gains a bonus use.|All damaging grenades are viable for Heavy Ordnance.
;    92.0   Biggest Booms                 Your grenades and standard rockets can inflict critical damage (50% chance for +3 damage).|Grenades, standard rockets, and MEC micromissiles can inflict critical damage (50% chance for +3 damage).|50% chance for critical damage is not affected by other critical chance modifiers.|Does not apply to non-damaging grenades or the concussion rocket or Bunker Buster abilities.|Grenade crits will grant +1 damage to ongoing damaging effects such as fire.
;    92.0   Concussion Rocket             Fire a special rocket that does limited damage but has a chance to stun or disorient organic enemies within its area of effect and leaves a cloud of smoke.|One use per mission.|Stun chances based on target's Will score and the soldier's gauntlet tier.|Disorientation chances based on target's Will score only.|Requires one action and ends the soldier's turn.|Elite Codexes and Psi Zombies are immune to all effects including damage.|Allies cannot be injured by this attack.
;    92.0   Chain Shot                    Take a shot with an aim penalty of 10. If you hit the target, you take another shot on the target automatically.|Chain Shot requires 2 ammo points.|Chain Shot has a 4 turn cooldown.|Chain Shot can be devastating against non-cover enemies, or when augmented with aim bonuses.
;    92.0   Combat Engineer               Your explosives do significantly greater damage to cover objects and other things on the battlefield.|More powerful than Sapper by itself, Combat Engineer stacks with Sapper to maximize environmental damage, although either perk alone will still destroy many cover objects.|Combat Engineer also prevents environmental damage from falling off from the center of an explosion, meaning you will destroy objects in a larger area.
;    92.0   Sustain                       If the soldier takes enough damage to be killed, they are immediately put in Stasis for 1 turn and their health is only reduced to 1 HP. This can only happen once per mission.|Beware that a sustained soldier may retain damaging status effects like poison or burning after emerging from Stasis.
;    92.0   Shooting Sharp                Your ranged attacks gain +2 armor piercing and +15 aim against units in cover.
;    93.0   Overkill                      Your ranged attacks deal +2 more damage to units at 50% HP or less.
;    93.0   Bombardier                    You may throw or launch grenades two additional tiles.|Your grenades have 2 tiles extra range.|This includes both launched and thrown grenades.
;    93.0   Demolition                    Unleash a volley of bullets at your target's cover, significantly damaging or destroying it. Deals no damage to your target.|Demolition requires 4 ammo points and has a 5 turn cooldown.|Demolition does increased environmental damage, and will destroy most cover objects.
;    93.0   Kill Zone                     Take a reaction shot against any enemy that moves or attacks within a cone of fire.|There is no limit to the amount of Kill Zone shots a soldier can take outside of ammo counts.|Kill Zone utilizes Squadsight, even if the soldier does not have the Long Watch ability.|Kill Zone has a 4 turn cooldown.
;    93.0   Sting Grenades                Your flashbang grenades have a 50% chance to stun enemies.|Enemies' innate flashbang resistance does not affect stun chance.
;    93.0   Crusader's Rage               Gain a 50% damage boost when at 50% HP or less. Reduce wound recovery times for this soldier by 6 HP.|Wound reduction does not work if the soldier entered a bleeding out state during the mission.
;    94.0   Bunker Buster                 Fire a special rocket that destroys buildings and other objects in the environment.|Fire a special rocket with a large area of effect that does moderate damage to enemies but huge damage to buildings, vehicles and other objects in the environment.|Requires both actions and usable only once per mission.

;    1.0    Salvo                         Launching or throwing grenades, using heavy weapons or using the Gauntlet's Rocket Launcher with your first action will not end your turn.|Soldiers with the Salvo ability are prime candidates for heavy armor.
;    1.0    Fire In The Hole              Your rockets are more accurate.|Your rockets are more likely to hit their intended point of impact, or at least close to it.|The maximum it can miss by is reduced by two tiles.
;    2.0    Shredder                      Your primary weapon attacks shred armor.|A successful shot with a conventional weapon will shred 1 armor from the target.|More advanced weapons will shred more armor from targets.
;    3.0    Low Profile                   Makes partial cover count as full.
;    4.0    Concussion Rocket             Fire a special rocket that does limited damage but has a chance to stun or disorient organic enemies within its area of effect and leaves a cloud of smoke.|One use per mission.|Stun chances based on target's Will score and the soldier's gauntlet tier.|Disorientation chances based on target's Will score only.|Requires one action and ends the soldier's turn.|Elite Codexes and Psi Zombies are immune to all effects including damage.|Allies cannot be injured by this attack.
;    5.0    Biggest Booms                 Your grenades and standard rockets can inflict critical damage (50% chance for +3 damage).|Grenades, standard rockets, and MEC micromissiles can inflict critical damage (50% chance for +3 damage).|50% chance for critical damage is not affected by other critical chance modifiers.|Does not apply to non-damaging grenades or the concussion rocket or Bunker Buster abilities.|Grenade crits will grant +1 damage to ongoing damaging effects such as fire.
;    6.0    Stiletto                      Shots fired with your primary weapon pierce 3 armor.
;    7.0    Rupture                       A Rupture shot grants a +50 bonus to critical hit chances and ensures that the target takes an additional +3 damage from all attacks in the future.|Rupture requires 3 ammo points.|Rupture has a 4 turn cooldown.|Ruptured targets take 3 additional damage from every attack.
;    8.0    Javelin Rockets               The range of your rockets is increased by 6 tiles and you may hit targets beyond your visual range.
; 
;    91.0   Ever Vigilant                 If you spend all of your actions on moves, you are granted an automatic overwatch shot at the end of the turn.|Ever Vigilant enables an extremely mobile style of play for the soldier.|LITERALLY any action other than moving will invalidate Ever Vigilant.
;    91.0   Aim                           Hunker Down now confers +20 Aim and +20 Crit to the first shot on the following turn.|The bonus granted by Aim can apply to any weapon shot.
;    91.0   Lick Your Wounds              Hunker Down restores 2 health when used, up to a maximum of 8 per mission, and removes poison, burning, and acid burning.|Hunker Down restores 2 health when used, up to a maximum of 8 per mission.|Removes poison, burning, and acid burning.
;    91.0   Walk Fire                     Take a highly accurate shot with +30 bonus to hit 66% damage and -30 crit. Uses 2 ammo.|This is a special shot in which the soldier adjusts their aim in the middle of an automatic weapon burst, conferring +30 aim and -30 crit and doing 66% damage.|Consumes 2 ammo.|Requires a burst-fire weapon; ability will not be available when a shotgun or sniper rifle is equipped as a primary weapon.
;    91.0   Grazing Fire                  Missed shots with your primary weapon have an additional roll to become a graze.|Missed shots with the soldier's primary weapon generally have a 50% chance to become a graze.|This effect occurs after normal hit-miss-graze processing.|Targets with a dodge score subtract that score from the ability's success chance.
;    91.0   Target Focus                  Your ranged attacks gain +10 aim and pierce 1 armor against unflankable enemies.|Unflankable enemies are ones that can't take cover, such as Drones, MECs and Berserkers.
;    91.0   Squadsight                    You can target enemies within squadmates' sight, provided there is line of sight to the target.|Squadsight is best augmented by high ground, allowing soldiers relatively clear sight lines and an additional aim bonus to offset Squadsight's aim penalty.|When using Squadsight, there is no limit on how far your targets can be, but an aim penalty accumulates with distance.|Overwatch shots do not use squadsight by default.
;    91.0   Hit and Run                   Once per turn, gain an additional action after taking a standard shot at a flanked or exposed target with your primary weapon. Cannot trigger on the same turn as Close Encounters.|Cannot be used on the same turn as Run and Gun.|Bonus full actions from Serial and Death from Above will be awarded first.
;    91.0   Area Suppression              Fire a barrage that pins down multiple targets within a 4-tile radius, granting reaction fire against anyone that moves, and imposing a -25 penalty to all targets' aim until suppression is removed. Cannot be used when concealed.|Area Suppression cannot be used when the soldier is concealed.|Any unit that attempts to move will face reaction fire as long as the suppressing unit has ammo remaining.|Does not work with shotguns or sniper rifles.|Area Suppression costs 3 ammo points to use, plus one additional ammo for each reaction shot. It has no cooldown.|Area suppression will be canceled if the suppressing unit is damaged.|If multiple units suppress a target, the aim penalty will not stack.|Suppression restricts many of the target's abilities, including the use of rockets and grenades.
;    92.0   Combat Engineer               Your explosives do significantly greater damage to cover objects and other things on the battlefield.|More powerful than Sapper by itself, Combat Engineer stacks with Sapper to maximize environmental damage, although either perk alone will still destroy many cover objects.|Combat Engineer also prevents environmental damage from falling off from the center of an explosion, meaning you will destroy objects in a larger area.
;    92.0   Open Fire                     Your ranged attacks gain 10 Aim and 10 Crit against targets that are at full health.
;    92.0   Mayhem                        Gain 25% bonus damage against enemies who attempt to move when suppressed.
;    92.0   Clutch Shot                   Once per mission, fire a pistol shot that cannot miss.
;    92.0   Lock 'N Load                  Kills with your primary weapon restore 1 ammo.
;    92.0   Covering Fire                 Reaction shots confer an aim malus on enemies and can now be triggered by any enemy action, not just movement.|If triggered by an enemy action, Covering Fire will trigger before the enemy action completes.|In addition, having the Covering Fire ability confers a temporary aim penalty upon any units you take a reaction shot at, regardless of whether it was a covering fire shot or not.
;    92.0   Sustain                       If the soldier takes enough damage to be killed, they are immediately put in Stasis for 1 turn and their health is only reduced to 1 HP. This can only happen once per mission.|Beware that a sustained soldier may retain damaging status effects like poison or burning after emerging from Stasis.
;    93.0   Cheap Shot                    Once per turn, gain a movement action after shooting with your primary weapon at a unit that was damaged this turn. Cannot trigger on the same turn as Knife Encounters.|Cheap Shot triggers if the target was previously damaged by any type of damage since the player's last turn, i.e. overwatch and damage over time during the enemy turn counts.|Works for Light 'em Up, Chain Shot and Banish in addition to the standard shot.|The movement action can be used to enter Shadow if it's off cooldown.
;    93.0   Danger Zone                   Area Suppression suppresses enemies in a 5-tile radius.
;    93.0   Overkill                      Your ranged attacks deal +2 more damage to units at 50% HP or less.
;    94.0   Bombardier                    You may throw or launch grenades two additional tiles.|Your grenades have 2 tiles extra range.|This includes both launched and thrown grenades.
;    94.0   Bunker Buster                 Fire a special rocket that destroys buildings and other objects in the environment.|Fire a special rocket with a large area of effect that does moderate damage to enemies but huge damage to buildings, vehicles and other objects in the environment.|Requires both actions and usable only once per mission.

;    3.0    Shredder                      Your primary weapon attacks shred armor.|A successful shot with a conventional weapon will shred 1 armor from the target.|More advanced weapons will shred more armor from targets.

;    91.0   Suppression                   Fire a barrage that pins down a target, grants reaction fire against it if it moves, restricts the use of many abilities, and imposing a -25 penalty to the target's aim.|Suppression costs 2 ammo points to use, but has no cooldown.|Suppression will be canceled if the suppressing unit is damaged.|If multiple units suppress a target, the aim penalty will not stack.|May not be used if sniper rifle or shotgun-class weapons are equipped.|Suppression restricts many of the target's abilities, including the use of rockets and grenades.
;    91.0   Squadsight                    You can target enemies within squadmates' sight, provided there is line of sight to the target.|Squadsight is best augmented by high ground, allowing soldiers relatively clear sight lines and an additional aim bonus to offset Squadsight's aim penalty.|When using Squadsight, there is no limit on how far your targets can be, but an aim penalty accumulates with distance.|Overwatch shots do not use squadsight by default.
;    92.0   Full Kit                      Grants +1 charge per grenade item in a utility slot.|Applies to explosive and support grenades as well as Battle Scanners.|Extra grenades provided by Smoker and Flashbanger abilities do not get extra charges.

;    92.0   Lockdown                      Gain +20 to hit against enemies who attempt to move when suppressed.|This stacks with other reaction fire bonuses.
;    92.0   Biggest Booms                 Your grenades and standard rockets can inflict critical damage (50% chance for +3 damage).|Grenades, standard rockets, and MEC micromissiles can inflict critical damage (50% chance for +3 damage).|50% chance for critical damage is not affected by other critical chance modifiers.|Does not apply to non-damaging grenades or the concussion rocket or Bunker Buster abilities.|Grenade crits will grant +1 damage to ongoing damaging effects such as fire.

;    92.0   Combat Engineer               Your explosives do significantly greater damage to cover objects and other things on the battlefield.|More powerful than Sapper by itself, Combat Engineer stacks with Sapper to maximize environmental damage, although either perk alone will still destroy many cover objects.|Combat Engineer also prevents environmental damage from falling off from the center of an explosion, meaning you will destroy objects in a larger area.
;    92.0   Traverse Fire                 After taking a standard shot with your primary weapon with your first action, you may take an additional non-movement action.
;    93.0   Stiletto                      Shots fired with your primary weapon pierce 3 armor.
;    93.0   Watch Them Run                After throwing or launching a grenade, you will automatically enter overwatch.
;    93.0   Sting Grenades                Your flashbang grenades have a 50% chance to stun enemies.|Enemies' innate flashbang resistance does not affect stun chance.
;    93.0   Crusader's Rage               Gain a 50% damage boost when at 50% HP or less. Reduce wound recovery times for this soldier by 6 HP.|Wound reduction does not work if the soldier entered a bleeding out state during the mission.

;    92.0   Serial                        A powerful chained shot ability. For every kill made with your primary weapon, your actions will be refunded but your damage and crit chance will be reduced for every subsequent attack.|Serial is meant to chain enemy kills in a single action, as every kill is essentially free.|Every successful kill does result in a reduction to critical hit chance and damage, however.|Serial has a 7 turn cooldown.
;    92.0   Whirlwind                     If you hit with a melee attack during your turn, gain a bonus move.|A soldier can only gain one move per turn with this ability.
;    92.0   Silent Killer                 Guarantees that the Reaper stays in Shadow with killing shots.|Allows a Reaper to stay safely in Shadow during the enemy turn if they kill a unit with their primary weapon.

;    92.0   Needle                        Shots taken in Shadow have +2 armor piercing.|Use Shadow's extra mobility to get close and deal major damage with Needle.|Only applies while the Reaper is in Shadow.
;    92.0   Sprinter                      Adds 3 extra movement points per turn
;    92.0   Killer Instinct               Activating Run and Gun grants +50% critical damage for the rest of the turn.

;    92.0   Reposition                    Once per turn, gain an additional move action after taking a standard shot at a flanked or exposed target with your primary weapon.|Works with Hit and Run.
;    93.0   Retribution                   Free Ripjack attacks on any enemies that enter or attack from melee range.|If an enemy begins their turn in an adjacent tile, Retribution will trigger if that enemy tries to attack the Skirmisher.|If an enemy does not begin their turn in an adjacent tile, then Retribution will trigger when that enemy moves into melee range.|Retribution does not trigger on your own turn.
;    93.0   Parkour                       The cooldown for the Skrimisher's Grapple is reduced by one turn.|Improves the Skirmisher's mobility around the map.
;    93.0   Reaper                        A devastating chain melee attack where the first melee attack cannot miss. Each melee kill in Reaper mode grants an extra action, but further melee attacks have reduced damage.|Reaper has a 4 turn cooldown.|Reaper cannot be combined with Run and Gun.|As the damage with each successful Reaper strike is reduced, careful ordering of targets may be required to ensure the longest chain of attacks.
;    93.0   Whiplash                      Attack an enemy with an electrical lash. This attack has a 4 turn cooldown.|Whiplash does extra damage to robotic enemies.|Whiplash requires one action and does not end your turn.|Whiplash has a 4 turn cooldown.
;    93.0   Crusader's Rage               Gain a 50% damage boost when at 50% HP or less. Reduce wound recovery times for this soldier by 6 HP.|Wound reduction does not work if the soldier entered a bleeding out state during the mission.
;    94.0   Reckoning                     Unlocks the Ripjack Charge.|You can trigger the Charge ability by placing the movement cursor over an enemy and right-clicking (as with Fleche on Shinobis).|Charge costs 1 action point, is not turn ending, and has a 4 turn cooldown.|A Skirmisher can perform a dash move with the Charge attack and it will still only cost 1 action point.
