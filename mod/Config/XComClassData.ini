;    1.0    Haywire Protocol              You may target robotic and mechanical enemies with your GREMLIN, attempting to hack them and seize control.|Hacking a robotic enemy or turret pits the Specialist's Hacking stat against the enemy's Tech Defense stat.|Upgrading your GREMLIN will lead to an increased Hacking stat.|Hacked robotic enemies can only be controlled for a short time.
;    1.0    Combat Protocol               Send the GREMLIN to an enemy to jolt them, dealing guaranteed damage, which is increased against robotic enemies.|Combat Protocol has two charges per mission.|Upgrading your GREMLIN will lead to more damage per charge.
;    1.0    Hack                          Attempt to remotely breach security on a network access point with your GREMLIN/BIT.|Map items (chests, workstations, etc.) can be hacked from a distance using the GREMLIN/BIT.

;    3.0    Blinding Protocol             Send the Gremlin to deploy a small flashbang on an enemy target, disorienting all enemy units within a small radius (reducing their Aim by 20 and Mobility by 6).|Works with Squadsight.|Blinding Protocol has a 4 turn cooldown and ends the turn.
;    4.0    Scanning Protocol             The GREMLIN can trigger an instant scan of the area, increasing the Specialist's sight radius substantially for one turn, and revealing any hidden or disguised enemies in view. Free Action.|Scanning Protocol has 2 initial charges.|Scanning Protocol gains bonus charges with improved Gremlins.|In addition to hidden and disguised enemies, enemies blocked from line of sight by walls or obstructions will also be revealed by Scanning Protocol.|Scanning Protocol is a free action.|If the Specialist is employed as Haven Advisor Scanning Protocol will reduce the chance of recruiting Faceless rebels by 40% (stacking cumulatively with other similar abilities).
;    5.0    Failsafe                      If you fail a hack, you prevent any negative effects from occurring.
;    6.0    Capacitor Discharge           Send the GREMLIN to a location where it emits a substantial electric discharge, damaging and potentially stunning all nearby units. Robotic units take more damage.|Capacitor Discharge has one charge per mission.|Capacitor Discharge will deal more damage as you upgrade your GREMLIN.

It does not need to be evacuated when the mission ends.
; 
;    91.0   Aim                           Hunker Down now confers +20 Aim and +20 Crit to the first shot on the following turn.|The bonus granted by Aim can apply to any weapon shot.

;    91.0   Aid Protocol                  Command your GREMLIN to move to a friendly target. It grants that target a bonus to Defense until the start of the next player turn.|Aid Protocol, if used with your first action, will not end your turn.|As Aid Protocol takes effect immediately, it can be used to defend against reaction fire from enemies.|More advanced GREMLIN models will increase the defensive bonus granted by Aid Protocol.

;    91.0   Deep Cover                    If you did not attack this turn, hunker down automatically.|Non-offensive actions like Reload can still be performed without invalidating Deep Cover.
;    91.0   Coup de Grâce                 Bonus to hit, damage, and critical chance with your weapon against a disoriented, stunned or panicking enemy.|Coup de GrÃ¢ce grants +50 aim, +50 critical chance and +2 damage against stunned and panicking enemies.|The bonuses are reduced against disoriented enemies.

;    92.0   Bluescreen Bombs              Your flashbang grenades now disorient robotic units and reduce their resistance to hacking.|Your flashbang grenades now disorient robotic units.|Your flashbang grenades also reduce robotic hack defense by 25.
;    92.0   Sustain                       If the soldier takes enough damage to be killed, they are immediately put in Stasis for 1 turn and their health is only reduced to 1 HP. This can only happen once per mission.|Beware that a sustained soldier may retain damaging status effects like poison or burning after emerging from Stasis.
;    92.0   Fortify                       Activate to grant +20 defense until the beginning of the next turn. Does not cost an action.

;    1.0    Bombardier                    You may throw or launch grenades two additional tiles.|Your grenades have 2 tiles extra range.|This includes both launched and thrown grenades.
;    1.0    Squadsight                    You can target enemies within squadmates' sight, provided there is line of sight to the target.|Squadsight is best augmented by high ground, allowing soldiers relatively clear sight lines and an additional aim bonus to offset Squadsight's aim penalty.|When using Squadsight, there is no limit on how far your targets can be, but an aim penalty accumulates with distance.|Overwatch shots do not use squadsight by default.
;    2.0    Salvo                         Launching or throwing grenades, using heavy weapons or using the Gauntlet's Rocket Launcher with your first action will not end your turn.|Soldiers with the Salvo ability are prime candidates for heavy armor.
;    3.0    Needle Grenades               Your explosives do not destroy loot when they kill enemies and deal 1 bonus damage to unarmored enemies.|You have received extra training that enables you to employ explosive grenades that deploy specialized slivers that leave enemy loot and corpse intact and tears through unreinforced material.|Loot and corpses of enemies killed by any other explosives of this soldier, such as heavy weapons, are also preserved.
;    4.0    Long Watch                    Allow Overwatch to trigger with Squadsight.|Like the Overwatch ability it upgrades, Long Watch suffers a base penalty to aim.|Long Watch also suffers the Squadsight penalty to aim that increases with distance.
;    5.0    Volatile Mix                  Your grenades' area of effect is increased by one tile.|Your grenades do regular and environmental damage in the expanded area of effect, and apply any additional effects there as well.
;    6.0    Biggest Booms                 Your grenades and standard rockets can inflict critical damage (50% chance for +3 damage).|Grenades, standard rockets, and MEC micromissiles can inflict critical damage (50% chance for +3 damage).|50% chance for critical damage is not affected by other critical chance modifiers.|Does not apply to non-damaging grenades or the concussion rocket or Bunker Buster abilities.|Grenade crits will grant +1 damage to ongoing damaging effects such as fire.
;    7.0    Combat Engineer               Your explosives do significantly greater damage to cover objects and other things on the battlefield.|More powerful than Sapper by itself, Combat Engineer stacks with Sapper to maximize environmental damage, although either perk alone will still destroy many cover objects.|Combat Engineer also prevents environmental damage from falling off from the center of an explosion, meaning you will destroy objects in a larger area.
;    8.0    Tandem Warheads               Your grenades, rockets and heavy weapons do full damage to the maximum extent of their area of effect.|Your grenades, rockets and heavy weapons do full damage to units to the maximum extent of their area of effect.|This doesn't apply to environmental damage.
; 
;    91.0   Deep Cover                    If you did not attack this turn, hunker down automatically.|Non-offensive actions like Reload can still be performed without invalidating Deep Cover.
;    91.0   Walk Fire                     Take a highly accurate shot with +30 bonus to hit 66% damage and -30 crit. Uses 2 ammo.|This is a special shot in which the soldier adjusts their aim in the middle of an automatic weapon burst, conferring +30 aim and -30 crit and doing 66% damage.|Consumes 2 ammo.|Requires a burst-fire weapon; ability will not be available when a shotgun or sniper rifle is equipped as a primary weapon.
;    91.0   Total Combat                  Throwing a grenade or using an item no longer ends the turn and grenades have no cooldown. In addition, you can throw grenades 2 tiles further and their radius is increased by 1. Grants a Grenade-only slot. Grants +5 aim and +1 mobility.|Total Combat adds even more flexibility to the Skirmisher's turns, allowing actions to be taken exactly when needed.|Removes the cooldown for grenades.|Grants both Bombard and Volatile Mix, hence it does not stack with either of them.
;    91.0   Aim                           Hunker Down now confers +20 Aim and +20 Crit to the first shot on the following turn.|The bonus granted by Aim can apply to any weapon shot.
;    91.0   Sapper                        Your explosives can destroy many cover objects.|Sapper allows frag grenades and other explosives to destroy many cover objects.
;    91.0   Light 'Em Up                  Standard shots with your primary weapon are not turn-ending.
;    91.0   Concentration                 Your grazing attacks are automatically upgraded to normal hits.|Attacks that would normally graze their target are automatically upgraded to normal hits.|Applies to primary weapons, secondary weapons, and pistols.

;    1.0    Heavy Weapons                 This soldier is trained to use the XCOM gauntlet, a combination Rocket Launcher and Flamethrower.|The XCOM gauntlet is an advanced device that carries both a mini-rocket launcher and a flamethrower.|The Rocket Launcher carries one rocket initially and that has a three-tile radius for its area of effect.|It may target anything in sight range.|Damage from rockets falls off from the point of impact.|The flamethrower is a short-range weapon that causes damage to multiple targets within a cone-shaped area of effect.|The flamethrower has two uses per battle. It does not damage mechanical units without upgrades.|Using either gauntlet ability requires one action and ends your turn.|Rocket accuracy is affected by the soldier's aim, target distance, and whether the soldier has used any actions already this turn. Low accuracy-rockets will have higher scatter values, meaning they are more likely to miss the target tile by greater distances. The rocket's maximum possible scatter is noted in the popup, while a value appearing with the targeting cursor will show the expected (average) scatter for a shot on that location.
;    1.0    Formidable                    Your gear includes an extra layer of protection, granting 2 bonus ablative hit points and 50% less damage from explosive attacks.|Formidable reduces explosive damage taken by 50%.
;    2.0    HEAT Warheads                 Your grenades now pierce up to 2 point(s) of armor and shred 1 additional point(s) of armor.|Your grenades now pierce (ignore) up to 2 point(s) of armor and shred 1 additional point(s) of armor.

;    4.0    Fire In The Hole              Your rockets are more accurate.|Your rockets are more likely to hit their intended point of impact, or at least close to it.|The maximum it can miss by is reduced by two tiles.
;    5.0    Dense Smoke                   Your smoke grenades confer an additional 10 defense.|Your smoke grenades confer an additional 10 defense to those within the smoke, for a total of 30.
;    5.0    Smoker                        Grants one free smoke grenade item to your inventory
;    6.0    Combat Engineer               Your explosives do significantly greater damage to cover objects and other things on the battlefield.|More powerful than Sapper by itself, Combat Engineer stacks with Sapper to maximize environmental damage, although either perk alone will still destroy many cover objects.|Combat Engineer also prevents environmental damage from falling off from the center of an explosion, meaning you will destroy objects in a larger area.
;    7.0    Tandem Warheads               Your grenades, rockets and heavy weapons do full damage to the maximum extent of their area of effect.|Your grenades, rockets and heavy weapons do full damage to units to the maximum extent of their area of effect.|This doesn't apply to environmental damage.

; 
;    91.0   Center Mass                   You do one additional point of base damage when using guns.|You do one additional point of base damage with your primary weapon, pistols or a sawed-off shotgun.
;    91.0   Coup de Grâce                 Bonus to hit, damage, and critical chance with your weapon against a disoriented, stunned or panicking enemy.|Coup de GrÃ¢ce grants +50 aim, +50 critical chance and +2 damage against stunned and panicking enemies.|The bonuses are reduced against disoriented enemies.
;    91.0   Squadsight                    You can target enemies within squadmates' sight, provided there is line of sight to the target.|Squadsight is best augmented by high ground, allowing soldiers relatively clear sight lines and an additional aim bonus to offset Squadsight's aim penalty.|When using Squadsight, there is no limit on how far your targets can be, but an aim penalty accumulates with distance.|Overwatch shots do not use squadsight by default.

;    91.0   Deadeye                       Take a shot with a small aim penalty for a significant damage boost.|Deadeye reduces the overall hit chance of a shot by 15%, but increases the base damage of the shot by 50%.|Deadeye has a 3 turn cooldown.|Works with Snap Shot.
;    91.0   Bring 'Em On                  Gain +1 damage on critical hits for every two enemies you can see, up to a maximum of +8.

;    92.0   Sustain                       If the soldier takes enough damage to be killed, they are immediately put in Stasis for 1 turn and their health is only reduced to 1 HP. This can only happen once per mission.|Beware that a sustained soldier may retain damaging status effects like poison or burning after emerging from Stasis.
;    92.0   Aggression                    Gain +5 critical chance for each enemy you can see, up to a maximum of 30.|Units visible at squadsight ranges do confer bonus.
;    92.0   Full Kit                      Grants +1 charge per grenade item in a utility slot.|Applies to explosive and support grenades as well as Battle Scanners.|Extra grenades provided by Smoker and Flashbanger abilities do not get extra charges.

;    1.0    Needle Grenades               Your explosives do not destroy loot when they kill enemies and deal 1 bonus damage to unarmored enemies.|You have received extra training that enables you to employ explosive grenades that deploy specialized slivers that leave enemy loot and corpse intact and tears through unreinforced material.|Loot and corpses of enemies killed by any other explosives of this soldier, such as heavy weapons, are also preserved.
;    2.0    Sapper                        Your explosives can destroy many cover objects.|Sapper allows frag grenades and other explosives to destroy many cover objects.

;    5.0    Combat Engineer               Your explosives do significantly greater damage to cover objects and other things on the battlefield.|More powerful than Sapper by itself, Combat Engineer stacks with Sapper to maximize environmental damage, although either perk alone will still destroy many cover objects.|Combat Engineer also prevents environmental damage from falling off from the center of an explosion, meaning you will destroy objects in a larger area.
;    6.0    Demolition                    Unleash a volley of bullets at your target's cover, significantly damaging or destroying it. Deals no damage to your target.|Demolition requires 4 ammo points and has a 5 turn cooldown.|Demolition does increased environmental damage, and will destroy most cover objects.

The shot can not do critical damage.|Stuns enemies for 2 actions if the shot hits (including if it grazes).|Stuns for an extra 2 actions if the shot crits, but the shot won't inflict the critical damage.|Disabling Shot requires 1 ammo to use.|Disabling Shot has a 5 turn cooldown.|Only Avatars and Psi Zombies can not be stunned.
;    8.0    Homing Mine                   Attach a claymore onto an enemy (does not alert the enemy).

; 
;    91.0   Salvo                         Launching or throwing grenades, using heavy weapons or using the Gauntlet's Rocket Launcher with your first action will not end your turn.|Soldiers with the Salvo ability are prime candidates for heavy armor.
;    91.0   Resilience                    Enemy attacks against you suffer a -30 penalty to critical hit chances.
;    91.0   Rapid Deployment              Activate this ability before throwing or launching a support grenade, and the throw will not cost an action.|Applies to Smoke Grenades, Flashbangs, Shaped Charges and Battle Scanners.|Rapid Deployment has a 3 turn cooldown.
;    91.0   Steady Hands                  If you did not move last turn, gain +10 Aim and +10 Critical chance.|The Steady Hands bonus does not stack over multiple turns.|Steady Hands doubles down on the need to find a high sniper's nest with good sightlines.

Also grants 5 will.|Enemy damage is reduced by 1 when in cover and attacked through that cover.|Cover against explosives and other indirect attacks is calculated from the point of the explosion.|Armor piercing effects do not eliminate this bonus.|This unit also permanently gains 5 will.|This ability does not provide defensive bonuses if the unit is disoriented, stunned, panicking, on fire or otherwise impaired.
;    91.0   Iron Curtain                  Special shot that does 50% of normal damage but reduces target mobility for the following 2 turn(s). Cone-based attack with primary weapon.|If this cone-based attack hits, Iron Curtain does 50% of normal damage and imposes -8 mobility to the enemy for 2 turn(s).|Iron Curtain has a 3 turn cooldown.|Uses 3 ammo.|Can be used after moving.|Iron Curtain does not work with shotguns or sniper rifles.|Allies in the cone can be hit by this ability.
;    91.0   Aim                           Hunker Down now confers +20 Aim and +20 Crit to the first shot on the following turn.|The bonus granted by Aim can apply to any weapon shot.

;    91.0   Grazing Fire                  Missed shots with your primary weapon have an additional roll to become a graze.|Missed shots with the soldier's primary weapon generally have a 50% chance to become a graze.|This effect occurs after normal hit-miss-graze processing.|Targets with a dodge score subtract that score from the ability's success chance.

;    1.0    Squadsight                    You can target enemies within squadmates' sight, provided there is line of sight to the target.|Squadsight is best augmented by high ground, allowing soldiers relatively clear sight lines and an additional aim bonus to offset Squadsight's aim penalty.|When using Squadsight, there is no limit on how far your targets can be, but an aim penalty accumulates with distance.|Overwatch shots do not use squadsight by default.
;    1.0    Fire In The Hole              Your rockets are more accurate.|Your rockets are more likely to hit their intended point of impact, or at least close to it.|The maximum it can miss by is reduced by two tiles.
;    2.0    Steady Hands                  If you did not move last turn, gain +10 Aim and +10 Critical chance.|The Steady Hands bonus does not stack over multiple turns.|Steady Hands doubles down on the need to find a high sniper's nest with good sightlines.
;    3.0    Javelin Rockets               The range of your rockets is increased by 6 tiles and you may hit targets beyond your visual range.
;    4.0    Fortify                       Activate to grant +20 defense until the beginning of the next turn. Does not cost an action. Has a 5 turn cooldown.|Activate to grant the soldier +20 defense until the beginning of the soldier's next turn.|Does not cost an action.|Fortify has a 5 turn cooldown.
;    5.0    Volatile Mix                  Your grenades' area of effect is increased by one tile.|Your grenades do regular and environmental damage in the expanded area of effect, and apply any additional effects there as well.
;    6.0    Avenger                       Once per turn, take a reaction shot with your primary weapon at a visible enemy that has fired upon a visible ally.|Avenger will not activate if this unit is shot at.|Can only activate during the enemy's turn.|Can only trigger once per turn.
;    7.0    Watch Them Run                After throwing or launching a grenade, you will automatically enter overwatch.
;    8.0    Tandem Warheads               Your grenades, rockets and heavy weapons do full damage to the maximum extent of their area of effect.|Your grenades, rockets and heavy weapons do full damage to units to the maximum extent of their area of effect.|This doesn't apply to environmental damage.
; 
;    91.0   Sapper                        Your explosives can destroy many cover objects.|Sapper allows frag grenades and other explosives to destroy many cover objects.
;    91.0   Survival Instinct             Gain 20 Defense and 20 Crit chance while injured.|The bonuses are lost if you are healed back to full health.
;    91.0   Aim                           Hunker Down now confers +20 Aim and +20 Crit to the first shot on the following turn.|The bonus granted by Aim can apply to any weapon shot.
;    91.0   Sentinel                      When in overwatch, you may take two reaction shots.|Reaction shots may only target an enemy once.
;    91.0   Locked On                     Gain +20 aim and +20 crit for successive shots at the same enemy unit.|Gain +20 aim and +20 crit for repeated shots at the same target. Not cumulative, and only applies to enemy units.|Area-of-Effect-based shots do not grant the bonus.
;    91.0   Light 'Em Up                  Standard shots with your primary weapon are not turn-ending.
;    91.0   Lick Your Wounds              Hunker Down restores 2 health when used, up to a maximum of 8 per mission, and removes poison, burning, and acid burning.|Hunker Down restores 2 health when used, up to a maximum of 8 per mission.|Removes poison, burning, and acid burning.
;    91.0   HEAT Warheads                 Your grenades now pierce up to 2 point(s) of armor and shred 1 additional point(s) of armor.|Your grenades now pierce (ignore) up to 2 point(s) of armor and shred 1 additional point(s) of armor.
;    92.0   Chain Shot                    Take a shot with an aim penalty of 10. If you hit the target, you take another shot on the target automatically.|Chain Shot requires 2 ammo points.|Chain Shot has a 4 turn cooldown.|Chain Shot can be devastating against non-cover enemies, or when augmented with aim bonuses.
;    92.0   Heavy Ordnance                Any damaging grenade in your grenade-only slot gains a bonus use.|All damaging grenades are viable for Heavy Ordnance.
;    92.0   Shooting Sharp                Your ranged attacks gain +2 armor piercing and +15 aim against units in cover.
;    92.0   Biggest Booms                 Your grenades and standard rockets can inflict critical damage (50% chance for +3 damage).|Grenades, standard rockets, and MEC micromissiles can inflict critical damage (50% chance for +3 damage).|50% chance for critical damage is not affected by other critical chance modifiers.|Does not apply to non-damaging grenades or the concussion rocket or Bunker Buster abilities.|Grenade crits will grant +1 damage to ongoing damaging effects such as fire.
;    92.0   Combat Engineer               Your explosives do significantly greater damage to cover objects and other things on the battlefield.|More powerful than Sapper by itself, Combat Engineer stacks with Sapper to maximize environmental damage, although either perk alone will still destroy many cover objects.|Combat Engineer also prevents environmental damage from falling off from the center of an explosion, meaning you will destroy objects in a larger area.

;    1.0    Salvo                         Launching or throwing grenades, using heavy weapons or using the Gauntlet's Rocket Launcher with your first action will not end your turn.|Soldiers with the Salvo ability are prime candidates for heavy armor.
;    1.0    Fire In The Hole              Your rockets are more accurate.|Your rockets are more likely to hit their intended point of impact, or at least close to it.|The maximum it can miss by is reduced by two tiles.
;    2.0    Shredder                      Your primary weapon attacks shred armor.|A successful shot with a conventional weapon will shred 1 armor from the target.|More advanced weapons will shred more armor from targets.
;    3.0    Low Profile                   Makes partial cover count as full.
;    4.0    Concussion Rocket             Fire a special rocket that does limited damage but has a chance to stun or disorient organic enemies within its area of effect and leaves a cloud of smoke.|One use per mission.|Stun chances based on target's Will score and the soldier's gauntlet tier.|Disorientation chances based on target's Will score only.|Requires one action and ends the soldier's turn.|Elite Codexes and Psi Zombies are immune to all effects including damage.|Allies cannot be injured by this attack.
;    5.0    Biggest Booms                 Your grenades and standard rockets can inflict critical damage (50% chance for +3 damage).|Grenades, standard rockets, and MEC micromissiles can inflict critical damage (50% chance for +3 damage).|50% chance for critical damage is not affected by other critical chance modifiers.|Does not apply to non-damaging grenades or the concussion rocket or Bunker Buster abilities.|Grenade crits will grant +1 damage to ongoing damaging effects such as fire.
;    6.0    Stiletto                      Shots fired with your primary weapon pierce 3 armor.
;    7.0    Rupture                       A Rupture shot grants a +50 bonus to critical hit chances and ensures that the target takes an additional +3 damage from all attacks in the future.|Rupture requires 3 ammo points.|Rupture has a 4 turn cooldown.|Ruptured targets take 3 additional damage from every attack.
;    8.0    Javelin Rockets               The range of your rockets is increased by 6 tiles and you may hit targets beyond your visual range.
; 
;    91.0   Area Suppression              Fire a barrage that pins down multiple targets within a 4-tile radius, granting reaction fire against anyone that moves, and imposing a -25 penalty to all targets' aim until suppression is removed. Cannot be used when concealed.|Area Suppression cannot be used when the soldier is concealed.|Any unit that attempts to move will face reaction fire as long as the suppressing unit has ammo remaining.|Does not work with shotguns or sniper rifles.|Area Suppression costs 3 ammo points to use, plus one additional ammo for each reaction shot. It has no cooldown.|Area suppression will be canceled if the suppressing unit is damaged.|If multiple units suppress a target, the aim penalty will not stack.|Suppression restricts many of the target's abilities, including the use of rockets and grenades.
;    91.0   Squadsight                    You can target enemies within squadmates' sight, provided there is line of sight to the target.|Squadsight is best augmented by high ground, allowing soldiers relatively clear sight lines and an additional aim bonus to offset Squadsight's aim penalty.|When using Squadsight, there is no limit on how far your targets can be, but an aim penalty accumulates with distance.|Overwatch shots do not use squadsight by default.
;    91.0   Aim                           Hunker Down now confers +20 Aim and +20 Crit to the first shot on the following turn.|The bonus granted by Aim can apply to any weapon shot.
;    91.0   Lick Your Wounds              Hunker Down restores 2 health when used, up to a maximum of 8 per mission, and removes poison, burning, and acid burning.|Hunker Down restores 2 health when used, up to a maximum of 8 per mission.|Removes poison, burning, and acid burning.
;    91.0   Target Focus                  Your ranged attacks gain +10 aim and pierce 1 armor against unflankable enemies.|Unflankable enemies are ones that can't take cover, such as Drones, MECs and Berserkers.
;    91.0   Hit and Run                   Once per turn, gain an additional action after taking a standard shot at a flanked or exposed target with your primary weapon. Cannot trigger on the same turn as Close Encounters.|Cannot be used on the same turn as Run and Gun.|Bonus full actions from Serial and Death from Above will be awarded first.
;    91.0   Ever Vigilant                 If you spend all of your actions on moves, you are granted an automatic overwatch shot at the end of the turn.|Ever Vigilant enables an extremely mobile style of play for the soldier.|LITERALLY any action other than moving will invalidate Ever Vigilant.
;    91.0   Grazing Fire                  Missed shots with your primary weapon have an additional roll to become a graze.|Missed shots with the soldier's primary weapon generally have a 50% chance to become a graze.|This effect occurs after normal hit-miss-graze processing.|Targets with a dodge score subtract that score from the ability's success chance.
;    91.0   Walk Fire                     Take a highly accurate shot with +30 bonus to hit 66% damage and -30 crit. Uses 2 ammo.|This is a special shot in which the soldier adjusts their aim in the middle of an automatic weapon burst, conferring +30 aim and -30 crit and doing 66% damage.|Consumes 2 ammo.|Requires a burst-fire weapon; ability will not be available when a shotgun or sniper rifle is equipped as a primary weapon.
;    92.0   Lock 'N Load                  Kills with your primary weapon restore 1 ammo.
;    92.0   Covering Fire                 Reaction shots confer an aim malus on enemies and can now be triggered by any enemy action, not just movement.|If triggered by an enemy action, Covering Fire will trigger before the enemy action completes.|In addition, having the Covering Fire ability confers a temporary aim penalty upon any units you take a reaction shot at, regardless of whether it was a covering fire shot or not.
;    92.0   Mayhem                        Gain 25% bonus damage against enemies who attempt to move when suppressed.
;    92.0   Open Fire                     Your ranged attacks gain 10 Aim and 10 Crit against targets that are at full health.
;    92.0   Combat Engineer               Your explosives do significantly greater damage to cover objects and other things on the battlefield.|More powerful than Sapper by itself, Combat Engineer stacks with Sapper to maximize environmental damage, although either perk alone will still destroy many cover objects.|Combat Engineer also prevents environmental damage from falling off from the center of an explosion, meaning you will destroy objects in a larger area.

;    1.0    Area Suppression              Fire a barrage that pins down multiple targets within a 4-tile radius, granting reaction fire against anyone that moves, and imposing a -25 penalty to all targets' aim until suppression is removed.

;    1.0    Suppression                   Fire a barrage that pins down a target, grants reaction fire against it if it moves, restricts the use of many abilities, and imposing a -25 penalty to the target's aim.|Suppression costs 2 ammo points to use, but has no cooldown.|Suppression will be canceled if the suppressing unit is damaged.|If multiple units suppress a target, the aim penalty will not stack.|May not be used if sniper rifle or shotgun-class weapons are equipped.|Suppression restricts many of the target's abilities, including the use of rockets and grenades.
;    1.0    Squadsight                    You can target enemies within squadmates' sight, provided there is line of sight to the target.|Squadsight is best augmented by high ground, allowing soldiers relatively clear sight lines and an additional aim bonus to offset Squadsight's aim penalty.|When using Squadsight, there is no limit on how far your targets can be, but an aim penalty accumulates with distance.|Overwatch shots do not use squadsight by default.
;    2.0    Fire In The Hole              Your rockets are more accurate.|Your rockets are more likely to hit their intended point of impact, or at least close to it.|The maximum it can miss by is reduced by two tiles.
;    3.0    Fortify                       Activate to grant +20 defense until the beginning of the next turn. Does not cost an action.

;    5.0    Lockdown                      Gain +20 to hit against enemies who attempt to move when suppressed.|This stacks with other reaction fire bonuses.

;    8.0    Danger Zone                   Area Suppression suppresses enemies in a 5-tile radius.
;

;    91.0   Aim                           Hunker Down now confers +20 Aim and +20 Crit to the first shot on the following turn.|The bonus granted by Aim can apply to any weapon shot.

;    91.0   Lick Your Wounds              Hunker Down restores 2 health when used, up to a maximum of 8 per mission, and removes poison, burning, and acid burning.|Hunker Down restores 2 health when used, up to a maximum of 8 per mission.|Removes poison, burning, and acid burning.

;    92.0   Covering Fire                 Reaction shots confer an aim malus on enemies and can now be triggered by any enemy action, not just movement.|If triggered by an enemy action, Covering Fire will trigger before the enemy action completes.|In addition, having the Covering Fire ability confers a temporary aim penalty upon any units you take a reaction shot at, regardless of whether it was a covering fire shot or not.
;    92.0   Combat Engineer               Your explosives do significantly greater damage to cover objects and other things on the battlefield.|More powerful than Sapper by itself, Combat Engineer stacks with Sapper to maximize environmental damage, although either perk alone will still destroy many cover objects.|Combat Engineer also prevents environmental damage from falling off from the center of an explosion, meaning you will destroy objects in a larger area.
;    92.0   Sustain                       If the soldier takes enough damage to be killed, they are immediately put in Stasis for 1 turn and their health is only reduced to 1 HP.

;    93.0   Lightning Hands               Fire your pistol at a target. This attack does not cost an action.|Lightning Hands can combo well with two-action abilities, as it does not prevent their use in the same turn.|Lightning Hands has a 3 turn cooldown.
;    93.0   Rupture                       A Rupture shot grants a +50 bonus to critical hit chances and ensures that the target takes an additional +3 damage from all attacks in the future.|Rupture requires 3 ammo points.|Rupture has a 4 turn cooldown.|Ruptured targets take 3 additional damage from every attack.
;    94.0   Disabling Shot                Stun enemies with a precise shot, with a bonus stun duration if the shot crits.

;    1.0    Sapper                        Your explosives can destroy many cover objects.|Sapper allows frag grenades and other explosives to destroy many cover objects.
;    1.0    Formidable                    Your gear includes an extra layer of protection, granting 2 bonus ablative hit points and 50% less damage from explosive attacks.|Formidable reduces explosive damage taken by 50%.
;    2.0    Steady Hands                  If you did not move last turn, gain +10 Aim and +10 Critical chance.|The Steady Hands bonus does not stack over multiple turns.|Steady Hands doubles down on the need to find a high sniper's nest with good sightlines.
;    3.0    Shredder                      Your primary weapon attacks shred armor.|A successful shot with a conventional weapon will shred 1 armor from the target.|More advanced weapons will shred more armor from targets.

; 
;    91.0   Squadsight                    You can target enemies within squadmates' sight, provided there is line of sight to the target.|Squadsight is best augmented by high ground, allowing soldiers relatively clear sight lines and an additional aim bonus to offset Squadsight's aim penalty.|When using Squadsight, there is no limit on how far your targets can be, but an aim penalty accumulates with distance.|Overwatch shots do not use squadsight by default.
;    91.0   Maim                          Fire a shot with your primary weapon that immobilizes the target until the end of their next turn. Uses 1 ammo.

;    91.0   Suppression                   Fire a barrage that pins down a target, grants reaction fire against it if it moves, restricts the use of many abilities, and imposing a -25 penalty to the target's aim.|Suppression costs 2 ammo points to use, but has no cooldown.|Suppression will be canceled if the suppressing unit is damaged.|If multiple units suppress a target, the aim penalty will not stack.|May not be used if sniper rifle or shotgun-class weapons are equipped.|Suppression restricts many of the target's abilities, including the use of rockets and grenades.
;    91.0   Sentinel                      When in overwatch, you may take two reaction shots.|Reaction shots may only target an enemy once.
;    91.0   Fire In The Hole              Your rockets are more accurate.|Your rockets are more likely to hit their intended point of impact, or at least close to it.|The maximum it can miss by is reduced by two tiles.
;    91.0   Lick Your Wounds              Hunker Down restores 2 health when used, up to a maximum of 8 per mission, and removes poison, burning, and acid burning.|Hunker Down restores 2 health when used, up to a maximum of 8 per mission.|Removes poison, burning, and acid burning.

;    92.0   Sustain                       If the soldier takes enough damage to be killed, they are immediately put in Stasis for 1 turn and their health is only reduced to 1 HP. This can only happen once per mission.|Beware that a sustained soldier may retain damaging status effects like poison or burning after emerging from Stasis.
;    92.0   Traverse Fire                 After taking a standard shot with your primary weapon with your first action, you may take an additional non-movement action.
;    92.0   Trench Warfare                If you get at least one kill during your turn, automatically Hunker Down at the end of it.|You will only Hunker Down if you would normally be able to.
;    92.0   Aggression                    Gain +5 critical chance for each enemy you can see, up to a maximum of 30.|Units visible at squadsight ranges do confer bonus.
;    92.0   Volatile Mix                  Your grenades' area of effect is increased by one tile.|Your grenades do regular and environmental damage in the expanded area of effect, and apply any additional effects there as well.

Has a 5 turn cooldown.|Activate to grant the soldier +20 defense until the beginning of the soldier's next turn.|Does not cost an action.|Fortify has a 5 turn cooldown.
;    92.0   Combat Engineer               Your explosives do significantly greater damage to cover objects and other things on the battlefield.|More powerful than Sapper by itself, Combat Engineer stacks with Sapper to maximize environmental damage, although either perk alone will still destroy many cover objects.|Combat Engineer also prevents environmental damage from falling off from the center of an explosion, meaning you will destroy objects in a larger area.
;    92.0   Biggest Booms                 Your grenades and standard rockets can inflict critical damage (50% chance for +3 damage).|Grenades, standard rockets, and MEC micromissiles can inflict critical damage (50% chance for +3 damage).|50% chance for critical damage is not affected by other critical chance modifiers.|Does not apply to non-damaging grenades or the concussion rocket or Bunker Buster abilities.|Grenade crits will grant +1 damage to ongoing damaging effects such as fire.

;    93.0   Sting Grenades                Your flashbang grenades have a 50% chance to stun enemies.|Enemies' innate flashbang resistance does not affect stun chance.
;    93.0   Crusader's Rage               Gain a 50% damage boost when at 50% HP or less. Reduce wound recovery times for this soldier by 6 HP.|Wound reduction does not work if the soldier entered a bleeding out state during the mission.
;    93.0   Watch Them Run                After throwing or launching a grenade, you will automatically enter overwatch.
;    94.0   Saturation Fire               Fire a cone shaped barrage of bullets at every enemy in an area. In addition, the cover of those enemies can be damaged or destroyed. Uses a lot of ammunition.|Saturation Fire requires 4 ammo points.|Saturation Fire has a 7 turn cooldown.|Saturation Fire will take a standard shot at every enemy in the cone, and will damage or destroy random cover elements in the cone.

;    4.0    Combat Engineer               Your explosives do significantly greater damage to cover objects and other things on the battlefield.|More powerful than Sapper by itself, Combat Engineer stacks with Sapper to maximize environmental damage, although either perk alone will still destroy many cover objects.|Combat Engineer also prevents environmental damage from falling off from the center of an explosion, meaning you will destroy objects in a larger area.
;    5.0    Stiletto                      Shots fired with your primary weapon pierce 3 armor.
;    6.0    Manual Override               Lowers all ability cooldowns on a selected ally soldier by up to 3 turns.|Use the allies' abilities early and often to take full advantage of Manual Override.|Costs 1 action.|Manual Override has a 4 turn cooldown.

;    91.0   Needle Grenades               Your explosives do not destroy loot when they kill enemies and deal 1 bonus damage to unarmored enemies.|You have received extra training that enables you to employ explosive grenades that deploy specialized slivers that leave enemy loot and corpse intact and tears through unreinforced material.|Loot and corpses of enemies killed by any other explosives of this soldier, such as heavy weapons, are also preserved.
;    91.0   Will To Survive               Enemy damage is reduced by 1 when in cover and attacked through that cover.

;    91.0   Steady Hands                  If you did not move last turn, gain +10 Aim and +10 Critical chance.|The Steady Hands bonus does not stack over multiple turns.|Steady Hands doubles down on the need to find a high sniper's nest with good sightlines.
;    91.0   Center Mass                   You do one additional point of base damage when using guns.|You do one additional point of base damage with your primary weapon, pistols or a sawed-off shotgun.
;    91.0   Lick Your Wounds              Hunker Down restores 2 health when used, up to a maximum of 8 per mission, and removes poison, burning, and acid burning.|Hunker Down restores 2 health when used, up to a maximum of 8 per mission.|Removes poison, burning, and acid burning.

;    92.0   Sustain                       If the soldier takes enough damage to be killed, they are immediately put in Stasis for 1 turn and their health is only reduced to 1 HP. This can only happen once per mission.|Beware that a sustained soldier may retain damaging status effects like poison or burning after emerging from Stasis.
;    92.0   Tactical Sense                Gain 3 defense for each enemy you can see, up to a maximum of 15 defense.|Gain 3 defense for each living enemy you can see, up to a maximum of 15 defense.|Units visible at squadsight ranges do not confer bonus.|This ability does not provide defensive bonuses if the unit is disoriented, stunned, panicking, on fire or otherwise impaired.

It grants that target a bonus to Defense until the start of the next player turn.|Aid Protocol, if used with your first action, will not end your turn.|As Aid Protocol takes effect immediately, it can be used to defend against reaction fire from enemies.|More advanced GREMLIN models will increase the defensive bonus granted by Aid Protocol.
;    1.0    Airdrop                       The GREMLIN grants an explosive grenade to the targeted ally. Usable 2 time(s) per mission.|Grants an explosive grenade to the targeted ally.|Airdrop initially confers a frag grenade, but as XCOM's technology improves it will instead provide a more advanced device.|Activating Airdrop uses one action and does not end the soldier's turn.|Activating Airdrop does not break concealment.|Usable 2 time(s) per mission.
;    1.0    Holo Targeting                Any directed primary weapon shot, hit or miss, will mark the target, increasing your squad's aim by +15 against this target.|Directed primary weapon-specific abilities will grant Holo Targeting.|Any abilities that target multiple units will not grant Holo Targeting.
;    1.0    Damn Good Ground              Confers +10 aim and +10 defense against targets at a lower elevation.|This ability does not provide defensive bonuses if the unit is disoriented, stunned, panicking, on fire or otherwise impaired.
;    1.0    Combat Protocol               Send the GREMLIN to an enemy to jolt them, dealing guaranteed damage, which is increased against robotic enemies.|Combat Protocol has two charges per mission.|Upgrading your GREMLIN will lead to more damage per charge.
;    2.0    Revival Protocol              Send the GREMLIN to an ally to remove any negative mental status effects: Disoriented, Stunned, Panicked, or Unconscious.|Revival Protocol can be used to revive unconscious soldiers, including those who have been stabilized after bleeding out.|Revival Protocol, if used with your first action, will not end your turn.|Starts with two charges, but upgrading your GREMLIN may provide more.
;    3.0    Blinding Protocol             Send the Gremlin to deploy a small flashbang on an enemy target, disorienting all enemy units within a small radius (reducing their Aim by 20 and Mobility by 6).|Works with Squadsight.|Blinding Protocol has a 4 turn cooldown and ends the turn.
;    4.0    Scanning Protocol             The GREMLIN can trigger an instant scan of the area, increasing the Specialist's sight radius substantially for one turn, and revealing any hidden or disguised enemies in view. Free Action.|Scanning Protocol has 2 initial charges.|Scanning Protocol gains bonus charges with improved Gremlins.|In addition to hidden and disguised enemies, enemies blocked from line of sight by walls or obstructions will also be revealed by Scanning Protocol.|Scanning Protocol is a free action.|If the Specialist is employed as Haven Advisor Scanning Protocol will reduce the chance of recruiting Faceless rebels by 40% (stacking cumulatively with other similar abilities).
;    4.0    Neutralizing Agents           Aid Protocol now neutralizes fire, poison, acid and bleeding.
;    5.0    Rescue Protocol               Use your GREMLIN to grant a movement action to an ally and grant them a small boost to dodge and mobility.|Rescue Protocol grants +15 dodge and +5 mobility.|Rescue Protocol can only be used on allies with no action points left.|It cannot be used on concealed, suppressing or overwatching units.|An ally cannot benefit from both Command and Rescue Protocol in the same turn.|Uses one action and does not end your turn.|Rescue Protocol has 2 charges per mission.|Charges increase with improved Gremlin technology.

; 
;    91.0   Suppression                   Fire a barrage that pins down a target, grants reaction fire against it if it moves, restricts the use of many abilities, and imposing a -25 penalty to the target's aim.|Suppression costs 2 ammo points to use, but has no cooldown.|Suppression will be canceled if the suppressing unit is damaged.|If multiple units suppress a target, the aim penalty will not stack.|May not be used if sniper rifle or shotgun-class weapons are equipped.|Suppression restricts many of the target's abilities, including the use of rockets and grenades.
;    91.0   Death From Above              Killing an enemy at a lower elevation with your primary weapon refunds a single action, and does not end your turn.

;    91.0   Squadsight                    You can target enemies within squadmates' sight, provided there is line of sight to the target.|Squadsight is best augmented by high ground, allowing soldiers relatively clear sight lines and an additional aim bonus to offset Squadsight's aim penalty.|When using Squadsight, there is no limit on how far your targets can be, but an aim penalty accumulates with distance.|Overwatch shots do not use squadsight by default.
;    91.0   Ever Vigilant                 If you spend all of your actions on moves, you are granted an automatic overwatch shot at the end of the turn.|Ever Vigilant enables an extremely mobile style of play for the soldier.|LITERALLY any action other than moving will invalidate Ever Vigilant.

;    91.0   Fire In The Hole              Your rockets are more accurate.|Your rockets are more likely to hit their intended point of impact, or at least close to it.|The maximum it can miss by is reduced by two tiles.
;    91.0   Area Suppression              Fire a barrage that pins down multiple targets within a 4-tile radius, granting reaction fire against anyone that moves, and imposing a -25 penalty to all targets' aim until suppression is removed. Cannot be used when concealed.|Area Suppression cannot be used when the soldier is concealed.|Any unit that attempts to move will face reaction fire as long as the suppressing unit has ammo remaining.|Does not work with shotguns or sniper rifles.|Area Suppression costs 3 ammo points to use, plus one additional ammo for each reaction shot.

In addition, Holotargeting no longer ends your turn.|Using your Holotargeter no longer ends your turn.|In addition, Rapid Targeting lets you periodically use Holotargeting against a single enemy as a free action.|This works with HiDef Holo, Independent Tracking, and Vital Point Targeting.|This does not stack with Multitargeting.|Rapid Targeting has a 4 turn cooldown.|Holotargeting does not break concealment for your squad.

;    91.0   Squadsight                    You can target enemies within squadmates' sight, provided there is line of sight to the target.|Squadsight is best augmented by high ground, allowing soldiers relatively clear sight lines and an additional aim bonus to offset Squadsight's aim penalty.|When using Squadsight, there is no limit on how far your targets can be, but an aim penalty accumulates with distance.|Overwatch shots do not use squadsight by default.

;    91.0   Flush                         Special shot with a bonus to hit that does little or no damage but confers defense and dodge penalties and forces target to change position if it hits.|Consumes 3 ammo.|Flush has a 3 turn cooldown.|+30 bonus to aim.|Cannot crit or apply bonus ammo effects.|Cannot be used from concealment.|Target loses 10 defense and 30 dodge.

;    91.0   Heavy Weapons                 This soldier is trained to use the XCOM gauntlet, a combination Rocket Launcher and Flamethrower.|The XCOM gauntlet is an advanced device that carries both a mini-rocket launcher and a flamethrower.|The Rocket Launcher carries one rocket initially and that has a three-tile radius for its area of effect.|It may target anything in sight range.|Damage from rockets falls off from the point of impact.|The flamethrower is a short-range weapon that causes damage to multiple targets within a cone-shaped area of effect.|The flamethrower has two uses per battle. It does not damage mechanical units without upgrades.|Using either gauntlet ability requires one action and ends your turn.|Rocket accuracy is affected by the soldier's aim, target distance, and whether the soldier has used any actions already this turn. Low accuracy-rockets will have higher scatter values, meaning they are more likely to miss the target tile by greater distances.

;    92.0   Sustain                       If the soldier takes enough damage to be killed, they are immediately put in Stasis for 1 turn and their health is only reduced to 1 HP. This can only happen once per mission.|Beware that a sustained soldier may retain damaging status effects like poison or burning after emerging from Stasis.
;    92.0   Napalm-X                      Your Flamethrower can now panic enemies.|Your Flamethrower can now panic enemies. Enemy units must pass a will check to avoid negative effects.

;    93.0   Fortress                      The soldier is immune to fire, poison, acid, and explosive damage.|A soldier with the Fortress ability can walk through fire, poison and acid with no ill effects.
;    93.0   Fire and Steel                Attacks with your gauntlet, and fires set by gauntlet weapons, do +1 damage.|This applies to both rocket launcher and flamethrower weapons, and the fires they set.

;    1.0    Suppression                   Fire a barrage that pins down a target, grants reaction fire against it if it moves, restricts the use of many abilities, and imposing a -25 penalty to the target's aim.|Suppression costs 2 ammo points to use, but has no cooldown.|Suppression will be canceled if the suppressing unit is damaged.|If multiple units suppress a target, the aim penalty will not stack.|May not be used if sniper rifle or shotgun-class weapons are equipped.|Suppression restricts many of the target's abilities, including the use of rockets and grenades.
; 
;    91.0   Area Suppression              Fire a barrage that pins down multiple targets within a 4-tile radius, granting reaction fire against anyone that moves, and imposing a -25 penalty to all targets' aim until suppression is removed.

;    91.0   Squadsight                    You can target enemies within squadmates' sight, provided there is line of sight to the target.|Squadsight is best augmented by high ground, allowing soldiers relatively clear sight lines and an additional aim bonus to offset Squadsight's aim penalty.|When using Squadsight, there is no limit on how far your targets can be, but an aim penalty accumulates with distance.|Overwatch shots do not use squadsight by default.
;    91.0   Aim                           Hunker Down now confers +20 Aim and +20 Crit to the first shot on the following turn.|The bonus granted by Aim can apply to any weapon shot.
;    91.0   Resilience                    Enemy attacks against you suffer a -30 penalty to critical hit chances.
;    91.0   Walk Fire                     Take a highly accurate shot with +30 bonus to hit 66% damage and -30 crit. Uses 2 ammo.|This is a special shot in which the soldier adjusts their aim in the middle of an automatic weapon burst, conferring +30 aim and -30 crit and doing 66% damage.|Consumes 2 ammo.|Requires a burst-fire weapon; ability will not be available when a shotgun or sniper rifle is equipped as a primary weapon.
;    91.0   Lick Your Wounds              Hunker Down restores 2 health when used, up to a maximum of 8 per mission, and removes poison, burning, and acid burning.|Hunker Down restores 2 health when used, up to a maximum of 8 per mission.|Removes poison, burning, and acid burning.
;    91.0   Grazing Fire                  Missed shots with your primary weapon have an additional roll to become a graze.|Missed shots with the soldier's primary weapon generally have a 50% chance to become a graze.|This effect occurs after normal hit-miss-graze processing.|Targets with a dodge score subtract that score from the ability's success chance.
;    91.0   Full Throttle                 Gain +3 mobility with every kill this turn. Lasts 2 turns, including the current one.|Only kills by the Skirmisher count towards Full Throttle.
;    91.0   Light 'Em Up                  Standard shots with your primary weapon are not turn-ending.
;    91.0   Fire In The Hole              Your rockets are more accurate.|Your rockets are more likely to hit their intended point of impact, or at least close to it.|The maximum it can miss by is reduced by two tiles.
;    91.0   Deadeye                       Take a shot with a small aim penalty for a significant damage boost.|Deadeye reduces the overall hit chance of a shot by 15%, but increases the base damage of the shot by 50%.|Deadeye has a 3 turn cooldown.|Works with Snap Shot.

;    92.0   Serial                        A powerful chained shot ability. For every kill made with your primary weapon, your actions will be refunded but your damage and crit chance will be reduced for every subsequent attack.|Serial is meant to chain enemy kills in a single action, as every kill is essentially free.|Every successful kill does result in a reduction to critical hit chance and damage, however.|Serial has a 7 turn cooldown.
;    92.0   Untouchable                   If you score a kill during your turn, the next attack against you during the enemy turn will miss.|When Untouchable is triggered the soldier is immune to the next damage dealing attack during the enemy turn, even Area of Effect attacks.
;    92.0   Sustain                       If the soldier takes enough damage to be killed, they are immediately put in Stasis for 1 turn and their health is only reduced to 1 HP.

;    92.0   Chain Shot                    Take a shot with an aim penalty of 10. If you hit the target, you take another shot on the target automatically.|Chain Shot requires 2 ammo points.|Chain Shot has a 4 turn cooldown.|Chain Shot can be devastating against non-cover enemies, or when augmented with aim bonuses.
;    93.0   Rupture                       A Rupture shot grants a +50 bonus to critical hit chances and ensures that the target takes an additional +3 damage from all attacks in the future.|Rupture requires 3 ammo points.|Rupture has a 4 turn cooldown.|Ruptured targets take 3 additional damage from every attack.

;    93.0   Ready for Anything            Enter overwatch after firing a standard shot with your primary weapon.
;    93.0   Soul Harvest                  Provides +10% crit chance. Each kill by this soldier adds +4% crit chance, to a maximum of +20%.|Bonus crit chance applies to both primary and secondary weapons.|The +20% max crit chance bonus applies only to the per-kill component, i.e. it's in addition to the base +10% bonus.
;    93.0   Demolition                    Unleash a volley of bullets at your target's cover, significantly damaging or destroying it. Deals no damage to your target.|Demolition requires 4 ammo points and has a 5 turn cooldown.|Demolition does increased environmental damage, and will destroy most cover objects.

;    1.0    Heavy Weapons                 This soldier is trained to use the XCOM gauntlet, a combination Rocket Launcher and Flamethrower.|The XCOM gauntlet is an advanced device that carries both a mini-rocket launcher and a flamethrower.|The Rocket Launcher carries one rocket initially and that has a three-tile radius for its area of effect.|It may target anything in sight range.|Damage from rockets falls off from the point of impact.|The flamethrower is a short-range weapon that causes damage to multiple targets within a cone-shaped area of effect.|The flamethrower has two uses per battle. It does not damage mechanical units without upgrades.|Using either gauntlet ability requires one action and ends your turn.|Rocket accuracy is affected by the soldier's aim, target distance, and whether the soldier has used any actions already this turn. Low accuracy-rockets will have higher scatter values, meaning they are more likely to miss the target tile by greater distances. The rocket's maximum possible scatter is noted in the popup, while a value appearing with the targeting cursor will show the expected (average) scatter for a shot on that location.
;    1.0    Damn Good Ground              Confers +10 aim and +10 defense against targets at a lower elevation.|This ability does not provide defensive bonuses if the unit is disoriented, stunned, panicking, on fire or otherwise impaired.
; 
;    91.0   Lick Your Wounds              Hunker Down restores 2 health when used, up to a maximum of 8 per mission, and removes poison, burning, and acid burning.|Hunker Down restores 2 health when used, up to a maximum of 8 per mission.|Removes poison, burning, and acid burning.
;    91.0   Squadsight                    You can target enemies within squadmates' sight, provided there is line of sight to the target.|Squadsight is best augmented by high ground, allowing soldiers relatively clear sight lines and an additional aim bonus to offset Squadsight's aim penalty.|When using Squadsight, there is no limit on how far your targets can be, but an aim penalty accumulates with distance.|Overwatch shots do not use squadsight by default.
;    91.0   Aim                           Hunker Down now confers +20 Aim and +20 Crit to the first shot on the following turn.|The bonus granted by Aim can apply to any weapon shot.
;    91.0   Salvo                         Launching or throwing grenades, using heavy weapons or using the Gauntlet's Rocket Launcher with your first action will not end your turn.|Soldiers with the Salvo ability are prime candidates for heavy armor.
;    91.0   Locked On                     Gain +20 aim and +20 crit for successive shots at the same enemy unit.|Gain +20 aim and +20 crit for repeated shots at the same target. Not cumulative, and only applies to enemy units.|Area-of-Effect-based shots do not grant the bonus.
;    91.0   Ever Vigilant                 If you spend all of your actions on moves, you are granted an automatic overwatch shot at the end of the turn.|Ever Vigilant enables an extremely mobile style of play for the soldier.|LITERALLY any action other than moving will invalidate Ever Vigilant.
;    91.0   Target Focus                  Your ranged attacks gain +10 aim and pierce 1 armor against unflankable enemies.|Unflankable enemies are ones that can't take cover, such as Drones, MECs and Berserkers.
;    91.0   Death From Above              Killing an enemy at a lower elevation with your primary weapon refunds a single action, and does not end your turn. Also grants a long-range accuracy bonus for sniper rifles.|Death From Above can combo well with pistol abilities or can simply make a soldier more mobile.|Also grants a long-range accuracy bonus for sniper rifles at any elevation.
;    91.0   Center Mass                   You do one additional point of base damage when using guns.|You do one additional point of base damage with your primary weapon, pistols or a sawed-off shotgun.
;    92.0   Biggest Booms                 Your grenades and standard rockets can inflict critical damage (50% chance for +3 damage).|Grenades, standard rockets, and MEC micromissiles can inflict critical damage (50% chance for +3 damage).|50% chance for critical damage is not affected by other critical chance modifiers.|Does not apply to non-damaging grenades or the concussion rocket or Bunker Buster abilities.|Grenade crits will grant +1 damage to ongoing damaging effects such as fire.
;    92.0   Hail of Bullets               Unleash a hail of bullets that is guaranteed to hit your target, but uses a lot of ammunition.|Hail of Bullets requires 3 ammo points.|Hail of Bullets has a 5 turn cooldown.|Hail of Bullets does not work with shotguns or sniper rifles.
;    92.0   Combat Engineer               Your explosives do significantly greater damage to cover objects and other things on the battlefield.|More powerful than Sapper by itself, Combat Engineer stacks with Sapper to maximize environmental damage, although either perk alone will still destroy many cover objects.|Combat Engineer also prevents environmental damage from falling off from the center of an explosion, meaning you will destroy objects in a larger area.
;    92.0   Implacable                    If you score one or more kills on your turn, you are granted a single bonus move.|The Fleche ability cannot be used after gaining a bonus move from Implacable.
;    92.0   Tactical Sense                Gain 3 defense for each enemy you can see, up to a maximum of 15 defense.|Gain 3 defense for each living enemy you can see, up to a maximum of 15 defense.|Units visible at squadsight ranges do not confer bonus.|This ability does not provide defensive bonuses if the unit is disoriented, stunned, panicking, on fire or otherwise impaired.
;    92.0   Clutch Shot                   Once per mission, fire a pistol shot that cannot miss.
;    92.0   Lock 'N Load                  Kills with your primary weapon restore 1 ammo.
;    92.0   Open Fire                     Your ranged attacks gain 10 Aim and 10 Crit against targets that are at full health.
;    92.0   Return Fire                   When targeted by enemy fire, automatically fire back with your primary weapon once per turn.|Return Fire will only trigger once per turn.|Return Fire can be triggered by melee attacks and area of effect attacks.|Return Fire will not trigger when targeted by overwatch fire.
;    92.0   Sustain                       If the soldier takes enough damage to be killed, they are immediately put in Stasis for 1 turn and their health is only reduced to 1 HP. This can only happen once per mission.|Beware that a sustained soldier may retain damaging status effects like poison or burning after emerging from Stasis.
;    92.0   Chain Shot                    Take a shot with an aim penalty of 10. If you hit the target, you take another shot on the target automatically.|Chain Shot requires 2 ammo points.|Chain Shot has a 4 turn cooldown.|Chain Shot can be devastating against non-cover enemies, or when augmented with aim bonuses.
;    93.0   Sting Grenades                Your flashbang grenades have a 50% chance to stun enemies.|Enemies' innate flashbang resistance does not affect stun chance.
;    93.0   Sting                         Fire a shot while in Shadow that holotargets for +10 Aim and ruptures for 1. Guaranteed to remain in Shadow.|Sting allows for the Reaper to attack in situations where they absolutely do not want to be revealed.|Sting has 2 charge(s) per mission, requires 1 ammo points, and has a 1 turn cooldown.
;    93.0   Rapid Fire                    Fire twice in a row at an enemy. Each shot suffers an Aim penalty of -15. Can be used once per turn.|Rapid Fire has a 1 turn cooldown.
;    93.0   Rapid Reaction                When in overwatch, each shot you hit with grants another reaction fire shot, up to a maximum of three shots.
;    93.0   Demolition                    Unleash a volley of bullets at your target's cover, significantly damaging or destroying it. Deals no damage to your target.|Demolition requires 4 ammo points and has a 5 turn cooldown.|Demolition does increased environmental damage, and will destroy most cover objects.
;    93.0   Stiletto                      Shots fired with your primary weapon pierce 3 armor.
;    94.0   Bombardier                    You may throw or launch grenades two additional tiles.|Your grenades have 2 tiles extra range.|This includes both launched and thrown grenades.
;    94.0   Disabling Shot                Stun enemies with a precise shot, with a bonus stun duration if the shot crits. The shot can not do critical damage.|Stuns enemies for 2 actions if the shot hits (including if it grazes).|Stuns for an extra 2 actions if the shot crits, but the shot won't inflict the critical damage.|Disabling Shot requires 1 ammo to use.|Disabling Shot has a 5 turn cooldown.|Only Avatars and Psi Zombies can not be stunned.

;    1.0    Avenger                       Once per turn, take a reaction shot with your primary weapon at a visible enemy that has fired upon a visible ally.|Avenger will not activate if this unit is shot at.|Can only activate during the enemy's turn.|Can only trigger once per turn.
; 
;    91.0   Smoker                        Grants one free smoke grenade item to your inventory
;    91.0   Aim                           Hunker Down now confers +20 Aim and +20 Crit to the first shot on the following turn.|The bonus granted by Aim can apply to any weapon shot.
;    91.0   Sapper                        Your explosives can destroy many cover objects.|Sapper allows frag grenades and other explosives to destroy many cover objects.
;    91.0   Rapid Deployment              Activate this ability before throwing or launching a support grenade, and the throw will not cost an action.|Applies to Smoke Grenades, Flashbangs, Shaped Charges and Battle Scanners.|Rapid Deployment has a 3 turn cooldown.
;    91.0   Phantom                       When the squad is revealed, this soldier remains concealed.|Even if the squad does not start a mission concealed, soldiers with Phantom will still begin the mission with concealment.|If the soldier with Phantom is the one who breaks squad concealment, then Phantom does not apply.
;    91.0   Lick Your Wounds              Hunker Down restores 2 health when used, up to a maximum of 8 per mission, and removes poison, burning, and acid burning.|Hunker Down restores 2 health when used, up to a maximum of 8 per mission.|Removes poison, burning, and acid burning.
;    91.0   Hard Target                   Gain 5 dodge per enemy you can see, up to a maximum of +30.|Units visible at squadsight ranges do not confer bonus.|This ability does not provide defensive bonuses if the unit is disoriented, stunned, panicking, on fire or otherwise impaired.
;    91.0   Grazing Fire                  Missed shots with your primary weapon have an additional roll to become a graze.|Missed shots with the soldier's primary weapon generally have a 50% chance to become a graze.|This effect occurs after normal hit-miss-graze processing.|Targets with a dodge score subtract that score from the ability's success chance.
;    91.0   Will To Survive               Enemy damage is reduced by 1 when in cover and attacked through that cover. Also grants 5 will.|Enemy damage is reduced by 1 when in cover and attacked through that cover.|Cover against explosives and other indirect attacks is calculated from the point of the explosion.|Armor piercing effects do not eliminate this bonus.|This unit also permanently gains 5 will.|This ability does not provide defensive bonuses if the unit is disoriented, stunned, panicking, on fire or otherwise impaired.
;    91.0   Deep Cover                    If you did not attack this turn, hunker down automatically.|Non-offensive actions like Reload can still be performed without invalidating Deep Cover.
;    91.0   Covert                        Enemies have 25% smaller detection range against you.|Enemies have 25% smaller detection range against you, as denoted by red tiles surrounding enemies who are not alerted to your presence.|This ability also grants a small reduction in this soldier's impact on infiltration times.|Does not apply to ADVENT security towers.
;    91.0   Center Mass                   You do one additional point of base damage when using guns.|You do one additional point of base damage with your primary weapon, pistols or a sawed-off shotgun.
;    91.0   Full Throttle                 Gain +3 mobility with every kill this turn. Lasts 2 turns, including the current one.|Only kills by the Skirmisher count towards Full Throttle.
;    92.0   Trench Warfare                If you get at least one kill during your turn, automatically Hunker Down at the end of it.|You will only Hunker Down if you would normally be able to.
;    92.0   Covering Fire                 Reaction shots confer an aim malus on enemies and can now be triggered by any enemy action, not just movement.|If triggered by an enemy action, Covering Fire will trigger before the enemy action completes.|In addition, having the Covering Fire ability confers a temporary aim penalty upon any units you take a reaction shot at, regardless of whether it was a covering fire shot or not.
;    92.0   Clutch Shot                   Once per mission, fire a pistol shot that cannot miss.
;    92.0   Reflex                        When fired upon, gain one extra action on the next turn. Triggers no more than once per turn. Attacks against you suffer a -15 penalty to critical hit chances.|The Grapple makes the Skirmisher a great advance scout, and Reflex rewards their aggressive positioning.|Reflex can only be triggered once per turn.
;    92.0   Sustain                       If the soldier takes enough damage to be killed, they are immediately put in Stasis for 1 turn and their health is only reduced to 1 HP. This can only happen once per mission.|Beware that a sustained soldier may retain damaging status effects like poison or burning after emerging from Stasis.
;    92.0   Traverse Fire                 After taking a standard shot with your primary weapon with your first action, you may take an additional non-movement action.
;    92.0   Lead the Target               Grants a +20% increased chance to hit, but delays the shot until the target takes an action on their turn. Costs two actions and has a 3 turn cooldown.|Carefully lead the target, granting a +20% increased chance to hit, but delaying the shot until the enemies turn. Takes two actions.|Lead The Target has a 3 turn cooldown.
;    93.0   Death Dealer                  Grants +25 crit chance. Critical shots against a flanked target while in Shadow will deal double critical damage.|Use Shadow's increased mobility and smaller enemy detection radii to flank enemies and deal massive damage.
;    93.0   Cheap Shot                    Once per turn, gain a movement action after shooting with your primary weapon at a unit that was damaged this turn. Cannot trigger on the same turn as Knife Encounters.|Cheap Shot triggers if the target was previously damaged by any type of damage since the player's last turn, i.e. overwatch and damage over time during the enemy turn counts.|Works for Light 'em Up, Chain Shot and Banish in addition to the standard shot.|The movement action can be used to enter Shadow if it's off cooldown.
;    93.0   Sting                         Fire a shot while in Shadow that holotargets for +10 Aim and ruptures for 1. Guaranteed to remain in Shadow.|Sting allows for the Reaper to attack in situations where they absolutely do not want to be revealed.|Sting has 2 charge(s) per mission, requires 1 ammo points, and has a 1 turn cooldown.
;    93.0   Sting Grenades                Your flashbang grenades have a 50% chance to stun enemies.|Enemies' innate flashbang resistance does not affect stun chance.
;    94.0   Close Combat Specialist       Fire a free reaction shot with your primary weapon at any visible enemy within four tiles who moves or fires.|Will not trigger if soldier is concealed.|You may shoot at each enemy with this ability once per turn.|Each shot requires 2 ammo.

;    1.0    Suppression                   Fire a barrage that pins down a target, grants reaction fire against it if it moves, restricts the use of many abilities, and imposing a -25 penalty to the target's aim.|Suppression costs 2 ammo points to use, but has no cooldown.|Suppression will be canceled if the suppressing unit is damaged.|If multiple units suppress a target, the aim penalty will not stack.|May not be used if sniper rifle or shotgun-class weapons are equipped.|Suppression restricts many of the target's abilities, including the use of rockets and grenades.

In addition, Holotargeting no longer ends your turn.|Using your Holotargeter no longer ends your turn.|In addition, Rapid Targeting lets you periodically use Holotargeting against a single enemy as a free action.|This works with HiDef Holo, Independent Tracking, and Vital Point Targeting.|This does not stack with Multitargeting.|Rapid Targeting has a 4 turn cooldown.|Holotargeting does not break concealment for your squad.
;    4.0    HiDef Holo                    Your Holotargeted enemies are easier to critically hit.|The critical hit bonus is +10 with the basic Holotargeter, but improves to +15 and +20 with advanced technology Holotargeting devices.

;    91.0   Area Suppression              Fire a barrage that pins down multiple targets within a 4-tile radius, granting reaction fire against anyone that moves, and imposing a -25 penalty to all targets' aim until suppression is removed.

;    91.0   Squadsight                    You can target enemies within squadmates' sight, provided there is line of sight to the target.|Squadsight is best augmented by high ground, allowing soldiers relatively clear sight lines and an additional aim bonus to offset Squadsight's aim penalty.|When using Squadsight, there is no limit on how far your targets can be, but an aim penalty accumulates with distance.|Overwatch shots do not use squadsight by default.

;    91.0   Fire In The Hole              Your rockets are more accurate.|Your rockets are more likely to hit their intended point of impact, or at least close to it.|The maximum it can miss by is reduced by two tiles.
;    91.0   Weapon Handling               Reduces the Aim penalty for short-range primary weapon shots by 67%.|Weapon Handling does not affect the aim penalty from Snap Shot.

;    92.0   Shooting Sharp                Your ranged attacks gain +2 armor piercing and +15 aim against units in cover.
;    92.0   Tactical Sense                Gain 3 defense for each enemy you can see, up to a maximum of 15 defense.|Gain 3 defense for each living enemy you can see, up to a maximum of 15 defense.|Units visible at squadsight ranges do not confer bonus.|This ability does not provide defensive bonuses if the unit is disoriented, stunned, panicking, on fire or otherwise impaired.

; 
;    91.0   Zone of Control               All enemies within the soldier's 5 tile radius suffer penalties of -15 Aim and -4 Mobility.
;    91.0   Steady Hands                  If you did not move last turn, gain +10 Aim and +10 Critical chance.|The Steady Hands bonus does not stack over multiple turns.|Steady Hands doubles down on the need to find a high sniper's nest with good sightlines.
;    91.0   Aim                           Hunker Down now confers +20 Aim and +20 Crit to the first shot on the following turn.|The bonus granted by Aim can apply to any weapon shot.
;    91.0   Roust                         Special Flamethrower shot that does limited damage but forces enemies to change their position.|Has a 20% chance to set enemies in the area of effect on fire and does limited damage.|The narrow jet of flame has less impact on the environment.|Units hit by the shot will be forced to move, often triggering overwatch fire.|One use per mission, but can gain an additional use with additional gear.|Cannot be used from concealment.
;    91.0   Heavy Weapons                 This soldier is trained to use the XCOM gauntlet, a combination Rocket Launcher and Flamethrower.|The XCOM gauntlet is an advanced device that carries both a mini-rocket launcher and a flamethrower.|The Rocket Launcher carries one rocket initially and that has a three-tile radius for its area of effect.|It may target anything in sight range.|Damage from rockets falls off from the point of impact.|The flamethrower is a short-range weapon that causes damage to multiple targets within a cone-shaped area of effect.|The flamethrower has two uses per battle. It does not damage mechanical units without upgrades.|Using either gauntlet ability requires one action and ends your turn.|Rocket accuracy is affected by the soldier's aim, target distance, and whether the soldier has used any actions already this turn. Low accuracy-rockets will have higher scatter values, meaning they are more likely to miss the target tile by greater distances. The rocket's maximum possible scatter is noted in the popup, while a value appearing with the targeting cursor will show the expected (average) scatter for a shot on that location.
;    91.0   Hipfire                       Firing the sawed-off shotgun no longer ends the turn.|With this ability, Point Blank and Both Barrels do not end the turn, allowing the soldier to shoot or move afterwards.
;    91.0   Impulse                       Your ranged attacks gain 10 aim and 10 critical chance if you have moved this turn.
;    91.0   Resilience                    Enemy attacks against you suffer a -30 penalty to critical hit chances.
;    91.0   Lick Your Wounds              Hunker Down restores 2 health when used, up to a maximum of 8 per mission, and removes poison, burning, and acid burning.|Hunker Down restores 2 health when used, up to a maximum of 8 per mission.|Removes poison, burning, and acid burning.
;    92.0   Pump Action                   Gain two extra ammo in your sawed-off shotgun.
;    92.0   Sustain                       If the soldier takes enough damage to be killed, they are immediately put in Stasis for 1 turn and their health is only reduced to 1 HP. This can only happen once per mission.|Beware that a sustained soldier may retain damaging status effects like poison or burning after emerging from Stasis.
;    92.0   Open Fire                     Your ranged attacks gain 10 Aim and 10 Crit against targets that are at full health.
;    92.0   Napalm-X                      Your Flamethrower can now panic enemies.|Your Flamethrower can now panic enemies. Enemy units must pass a will check to avoid negative effects.
;    92.0   Burnout                       Activating your Flamethrower leaves a small smoke cloud around your position, providing a defensive bonus.|When fired, your Flamethrower leaves a small smoke cloud around your position, providing a +20 defensive bonus to anyone within.|Area of effect radius of smoke cloud is 1.5 tiles.
;    93.0   Overkill                      Your ranged attacks deal +2 more damage to units at 50% HP or less.
;    93.0   Phosphorus                    Your flamethrower's base damage can now ignore fire immunities, and shred armor.|Your flamethrower can now ignore fire immunities.|Flamethrower attacks shred 1 armor.
;    93.0   Incinerator                   Your flamethrower has an increased range and covers a wider area of effect.|The length of the flamethrower increases by 2 tiles and the width increases by 1 tile.
;    93.0   Ruthless                      Killing a panicked or disoriented enemy with your sawed-off shotgun refunds one action point.|By cleverly combining the effects of Brutality and Ruthless, you can kill multiple enemies per turn with your sawed-off shotgun.|There is no limit to the number of Ruthless activations per turn.
;    93.0   Scrap Metal                   Kills with your primary weapon restore one sawed-off shotgun charge.|This does not apply to kills from using the sawed-off shotgun itself.|This ability cannot grant ammo if the sawed-off shotgun charges are already at their starting value.
;    93.0   Fire and Steel                Attacks with your gauntlet, and fires set by gauntlet weapons, do +1 damage.|This applies to both rocket launcher and flamethrower weapons, and the fires they set.
;    93.0   Brutality                     Killing organic enemies with your sawed-off shotgun have a 50% chance to panic other organic enemies within 10 tiles of the target.|Use Brutality as a crowd-control tool to allow the soldier to move forward more aggressively and combine it with the Ruthless ability to increase your killing power.
;    94.0   Lethal                        You do 2 additional points of base damage and 1 additional point(s) of bonus critical damage with your primary weapon.
;    94.0   Quickburn                     Activate so your next use of the flamethrower will not cost an action.|Quickburn has a 5 turn cooldown.
;    94.0   Firestorm                     Once per battle, attack all units in a complete circle around the soldier's position. Also grants immunity to fire damage.|This will light fires and do fire damage to all enemies in a circle around the soldier's position, doing +2 bonus damage over regular Flamethrower attacks.|Firestorm also grants immunity to fire damage.|Requires one action point and will end the soldier's turn when used.|Usable once per battle.|It is not recommended the soldier uses Firestorm on rooftops.
;    94.0   None Shall Pass               During enemy turns, fire a free reaction shot that can critically hit with your sawed-off shotgun at any visible enemy within 3 tiles who moves or fires. Can only trigger once per turn.|Will not trigger if soldier is concealed.|Only triggers once per turn.|Uses 1 ammo and will only trigger if the sawed-off shotgun is loaded.|Can critically hit.|Works during any enemy turn: alien, Lost, Chosen and Ruler.

;    91.0   Target Focus                  Your ranged attacks gain +10 aim and pierce 1 armor against unflankable enemies.|Unflankable enemies are ones that can't take cover, such as Drones, MECs and Berserkers.

;    91.0   Squadsight                    You can target enemies within squadmates' sight, provided there is line of sight to the target.|Squadsight is best augmented by high ground, allowing soldiers relatively clear sight lines and an additional aim bonus to offset Squadsight's aim penalty.|When using Squadsight, there is no limit on how far your targets can be, but an aim penalty accumulates with distance.|Overwatch shots do not use squadsight by default.
;    91.0   Lick Your Wounds              Hunker Down restores 2 health when used, up to a maximum of 8 per mission, and removes poison, burning, and acid burning.|Hunker Down restores 2 health when used, up to a maximum of 8 per mission.|Removes poison, burning, and acid burning.

;    91.0   Needle Grenades               Your explosives do not destroy loot when they kill enemies and deal 1 bonus damage to unarmored enemies.|You have received extra training that enables you to employ explosive grenades that deploy specialized slivers that leave enemy loot and corpse intact and tears through unreinforced material.|Loot and corpses of enemies killed by any other explosives of this soldier, such as heavy weapons, are also preserved.
;    91.0   Resilience                    Enemy attacks against you suffer a -30 penalty to critical hit chances.
;    91.0   Precision Shot                Take a special shot with +30 bonus to critical chance and 34% bonus critical damage. Has a 4 turn cooldown.
;    92.0   Sustain                       If the soldier takes enough damage to be killed, they are immediately put in Stasis for 1 turn and their health is only reduced to 1 HP. This can only happen once per mission.|Beware that a sustained soldier may retain damaging status effects like poison or burning after emerging from Stasis.
;    92.0   Protector                     Non-damaging grenades in your grenade-only slot gain a bonus use.|All non-damaging grenades except Ghost Grenades are viable for Protector.

Starts with one charge, and is a free action.|Give a friendly unit 30 Dodge until the start of your next turn.|Killing an enemy unit grants an extra charge.|Usable once per turn.|Starts with one charge and is a free action.
;    92.0   Clutch Shot                   Once per mission, fire a pistol shot that cannot miss.
;    92.0   Traverse Fire                 After taking a standard shot with your primary weapon with your first action, you may take an additional non-movement action.
;    93.0   Rapid Reaction                When in overwatch, each shot you hit with grants another reaction fire shot, up to a maximum of three shots.

; 
;    91.0   Area Suppression              Fire a barrage that pins down multiple targets within a 4-tile radius, granting reaction fire against anyone that moves, and imposing a -25 penalty to all targets' aim until suppression is removed. Cannot be used when concealed.|Area Suppression cannot be used when the soldier is concealed.|Any unit that attempts to move will face reaction fire as long as the suppressing unit has ammo remaining.|Does not work with shotguns or sniper rifles.|Area Suppression costs 3 ammo points to use, plus one additional ammo for each reaction shot. It has no cooldown.|Area suppression will be canceled if the suppressing unit is damaged.|If multiple units suppress a target, the aim penalty will not stack.|Suppression restricts many of the target's abilities, including the use of rockets and grenades.
;    91.0   Squadsight                    You can target enemies within squadmates' sight, provided there is line of sight to the target.|Squadsight is best augmented by high ground, allowing soldiers relatively clear sight lines and an additional aim bonus to offset Squadsight's aim penalty.|When using Squadsight, there is no limit on how far your targets can be, but an aim penalty accumulates with distance.|Overwatch shots do not use squadsight by default.
;    91.0   Bring 'Em On                  Gain +1 damage on critical hits for every two enemies you can see, up to a maximum of +8. Works for the soldier's primary weapon and explosives.|Gain +1 damage on critical hits for every two enemies you can see, up to a maximum of +8.|Units visible at squadsight ranges do confer bonus.|Applies to damage from the soldier's primary weapon and, if the soldier has Biggest Booms, explosives (damaging grenades, rockets, etc.).
;    91.0   Aim                           Hunker Down now confers +20 Aim and +20 Crit to the first shot on the following turn.|The bonus granted by Aim can apply to any weapon shot.
;    91.0   Needle Grenades               Your explosives do not destroy loot when they kill enemies and deal 1 bonus damage to unarmored enemies.|You have received extra training that enables you to employ explosive grenades that deploy specialized slivers that leave enemy loot and corpse intact and tears through unreinforced material.|Loot and corpses of enemies killed by any other explosives of this soldier, such as heavy weapons, are also preserved.
;    91.0   Locked On                     Gain +20 aim and +20 crit for successive shots at the same enemy unit.|Gain +20 aim and +20 crit for repeated shots at the same target. Not cumulative, and only applies to enemy units.|Area-of-Effect-based shots do not grant the bonus.
;    91.0   Lick Your Wounds              Hunker Down restores 2 health when used, up to a maximum of 8 per mission, and removes poison, burning, and acid burning.|Hunker Down restores 2 health when used, up to a maximum of 8 per mission.|Removes poison, burning, and acid burning.
;    92.0   Aggression                    Gain +5 critical chance for each enemy you can see, up to a maximum of 30.|Units visible at squadsight ranges do confer bonus.
;    92.0   Open Fire                     Your ranged attacks gain 10 Aim and 10 Crit against targets that are at full health.
;    92.0   Implacable                    If you score one or more kills on your turn, you are granted a single bonus move.|The Fleche ability cannot be used after gaining a bonus move from Implacable.
;    92.0   Fortify                       Activate to grant +20 defense until the beginning of the next turn. Does not cost an action. Has a 5 turn cooldown.|Activate to grant the soldier +20 defense until the beginning of the soldier's next turn.|Does not cost an action.|Fortify has a 5 turn cooldown.
;    92.0   Covering Fire                 Reaction shots confer an aim malus on enemies and can now be triggered by any enemy action, not just movement.|If triggered by an enemy action, Covering Fire will trigger before the enemy action completes.|In addition, having the Covering Fire ability confers a temporary aim penalty upon any units you take a reaction shot at, regardless of whether it was a covering fire shot or not.
;    92.0   Combat Engineer               Your explosives do significantly greater damage to cover objects and other things on the battlefield.|More powerful than Sapper by itself, Combat Engineer stacks with Sapper to maximize environmental damage, although either perk alone will still destroy many cover objects.|Combat Engineer also prevents environmental damage from falling off from the center of an explosion, meaning you will destroy objects in a larger area.
;    92.0   Chain Shot                    Take a shot with an aim penalty of 10. If you hit the target, you take another shot on the target automatically.|Chain Shot requires 2 ammo points.|Chain Shot has a 4 turn cooldown.|Chain Shot can be devastating against non-cover enemies, or when augmented with aim bonuses.
;    92.0   Hail of Bullets               Unleash a hail of bullets that is guaranteed to hit your target, but uses a lot of ammunition.|Hail of Bullets requires 3 ammo points.|Hail of Bullets has a 5 turn cooldown.|Hail of Bullets does not work with shotguns or sniper rifles.
;    92.0   Sustain                       If the soldier takes enough damage to be killed, they are immediately put in Stasis for 1 turn and their health is only reduced to 1 HP. This can only happen once per mission.|Beware that a sustained soldier may retain damaging status effects like poison or burning after emerging from Stasis.
;    93.0   Stiletto                      Shots fired with your primary weapon pierce 3 armor.
;    93.0   Demolition                    Unleash a volley of bullets at your target's cover, significantly damaging or destroying it. Deals no damage to your target.|Demolition requires 4 ammo points and has a 5 turn cooldown.|Demolition does increased environmental damage, and will destroy most cover objects.
;    93.0   Ready for Anything            Enter overwatch after firing a standard shot with your primary weapon.
;    94.0   Lethal                        You do 2 additional points of base damage and 1 additional point(s) of bonus critical damage with your primary weapon.
;    94.0   Bombardier                    You may throw or launch grenades two additional tiles.|Your grenades have 2 tiles extra range.|This includes both launched and thrown grenades.

;    1.0    Holo Targeting                Any directed primary weapon shot, hit or miss, will mark the target, increasing your squad's aim by +15 against this target.|Directed primary weapon-specific abilities will grant Holo Targeting.|Any abilities that target multiple units will not grant Holo Targeting.
;    1.0    Suppression                   Fire a barrage that pins down a target, grants reaction fire against it if it moves, restricts the use of many abilities, and imposing a -25 penalty to the target's aim.|Suppression costs 2 ammo points to use, but has no cooldown.|Suppression will be canceled if the suppressing unit is damaged.|If multiple units suppress a target, the aim penalty will not stack.|May not be used if sniper rifle or shotgun-class weapons are equipped.|Suppression restricts many of the target's abilities, including the use of rockets and grenades.
; 
;    91.0   Deep Cover                    If you did not attack this turn, hunker down automatically.|Non-offensive actions like Reload can still be performed without invalidating Deep Cover.
;    91.0   Target Focus                  Your ranged attacks gain +10 aim and pierce 1 armor against unflankable enemies.|Unflankable enemies are ones that can't take cover, such as Drones, MECs and Berserkers.
;    91.0   Steady Hands                  If you did not move last turn, gain +10 Aim and +10 Critical chance.|The Steady Hands bonus does not stack over multiple turns.|Steady Hands doubles down on the need to find a high sniper's nest with good sightlines.
;    91.0   Squadsight                    You can target enemies within squadmates' sight, provided there is line of sight to the target.|Squadsight is best augmented by high ground, allowing soldiers relatively clear sight lines and an additional aim bonus to offset Squadsight's aim penalty.|When using Squadsight, there is no limit on how far your targets can be, but an aim penalty accumulates with distance.|Overwatch shots do not use squadsight by default.
;    91.0   Aim                           Hunker Down now confers +20 Aim and +20 Crit to the first shot on the following turn.|The bonus granted by Aim can apply to any weapon shot.
;    91.0   Weapon Handling               Reduces the Aim penalty for short-range primary weapon shots by 67%.|Weapon Handling does not affect the aim penalty from Snap Shot.
;    91.0   Lick Your Wounds              Hunker Down restores 2 health when used, up to a maximum of 8 per mission, and removes poison, burning, and acid burning.|Hunker Down restores 2 health when used, up to a maximum of 8 per mission.|Removes poison, burning, and acid burning.
;    92.0   Paramedic                     Gain a free medikit. Equipped medikits have 2 extra charges. Using a medikit for the first time in a turn is a free action. Healing abilities restore 3 additional hit points.
;    92.0   Trojan                        Enemy units that are hacked take damage and lose their actions on the turn the hack effect ends.|Enemy units hacked by Haywire Protocol take 0 to 8 damage and lose their actions on the turn the hack effect ends.|Applies to units stunned or taken over by Haywire Protocol.|Damage calculated based on Hacking Stat vs. target's Hack Defense.
;    92.0   Lockdown                      Gain +20 to hit against enemies who attempt to move when suppressed.|This stacks with other reaction fire bonuses.
;    92.0   Sustain                       If the soldier takes enough damage to be killed, they are immediately put in Stasis for 1 turn and their health is only reduced to 1 HP. This can only happen once per mission.|Beware that a sustained soldier may retain damaging status effects like poison or burning after emerging from Stasis.
;    92.0   Tactical Sense                Gain 3 defense for each enemy you can see, up to a maximum of 15 defense.|Gain 3 defense for each living enemy you can see, up to a maximum of 15 defense.|Units visible at squadsight ranges do not confer bonus.|This ability does not provide defensive bonuses if the unit is disoriented, stunned, panicking, on fire or otherwise impaired.
;    92.0   Trench Warfare                If you get at least one kill during your turn, automatically Hunker Down at the end of it.|You will only Hunker Down if you would normally be able to.
;    92.0   Remote Start                  Detonate an environmental explosive, causing it to deal double damage within twice its normal radius. Does not reveal the Reaper.|Make sure squadmates are clear of the blast zone!|Remote Start requires 1 ammo point, and has a 5 turn cooldown.|Remote Start has 1 charge(s) per mission.
;    92.0   Shooting Sharp                Your ranged attacks gain +2 armor piercing and +15 aim against units in cover.
;    93.0   Savior                        Healing abilities restore four additional hit points.|Effect applies to GREMLIN heal, Medikits and Restoration abilities.
;    93.0   Long Watch                    Allow Overwatch to trigger with Squadsight.|Like the Overwatch ability it upgrades, Long Watch suffers a base penalty to aim.|Long Watch also suffers the Squadsight penalty to aim that increases with distance.
;    93.0   Sting                         Fire a shot while in Shadow that holotargets for +10 Aim and ruptures for 1. Guaranteed to remain in Shadow.|Sting allows for the Reaper to attack in situations where they absolutely do not want to be revealed.|Sting has 2 charge(s) per mission, requires 1 ammo points, and has a 1 turn cooldown.
;    94.0   Full Override                 Take permanent control of a robotic unit and potentially acquire ADVENT MECs for the Resistance.|Full Override is a special hack action usable against enemy robotic units.|It has one charge that is only expended if a successful override occurs.|Requires one action and ends the soldier's turn.|The first hack option, Greater Shutdown, will disable (stun) the unit for 3 turns.|The second hack option, Master Enemy, will grant control of the unit for rest of the mission with a stat bonus for all robots, and will permanently transfer any MEC units to the Resistance.|If the Master Enemy hack succeeds, and the MEC and the specialist both survive the mission, the MEC will follow new programming and make its way to a Resistance base, where it will serve the Resistance. It does not need to be evacuated when the mission ends.
