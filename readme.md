process.py
this pulls in the data file and summarizes parts of it for pushing back into other sheets.  
This is a platform for doing this type of thing, but isn't part of the regular pipeline - 
it's for a series of one-off custom procedures.

make_class.py
this takes in the same data file, and outputs .ini files to be put into a mod folder in the game
* XComClassData.ini - this holds the class definitions for each soldier
* XComGameData.ini - this holds the initial loadout definitions for each soldier
