Title=WOTC_GIJoe
Description=Highly accurate character pool, based on classic representations.  84 main characters, each with an INDIVIDUALIZED CLASS...the 'trait' powers are distributed in such a way that they make sense for the characters, while maintaining a balance within the pool, and without repeating any pairs...every Joe is different, and every Joe 'feels' right.  Additionally, many secondary characters are available for usage as VIPs/Dark VIPs, or for customization as soldiers.  

Requires WOTC along with all DLC and about 75 mods, mostly cosmetic and the family of mods surrounding Musashi's RPG Overhaul.
